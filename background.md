Where the first table describes a character as "raised by," it should be understood that the named person is still alive when the character enters the campaign. To determine their age, randomly determine which order the character falls if there are any siblings. The first sibling is born into a family when the mother is between the age of 14 and 20. Count the father's age as 3d4-4 added to the mother's age. Each subsequent child is born at a 1-3 year interval. This should give the approximate age of the character's parents. If the placement cannot be reconciled, assume elder siblings are twins or triplets if needed. Mentors will be 5d6+20 years older than the character.

If a character has a living twin, they may at the referee's discretion play both characters. Identical twins have the same ability scores as the first character. For fraternal twins, add 2d8-5 to each of the original character's ability scores to get the twin's ability scores.

### Institution

Normally, a character will have started training in their class at the age of 8 to 10. The institution below is a formative circumstance in the child's life, a place where he or she spent enough time to make an impression and shape their outlook later on. If more than one column applies, both institutions had an influence at some point.

- **Baggage camp**: the character spent their childhood following military camps through campaigns, helping to cook, launder clothes, make food, nurse wounded, carry baggage, and otherwise act as a servant to soldiers. Most likely, he or she began training as a warrior while still on the move, taught by soldiers present, not doing any particularly formal training until older, about the age of 13.
- **Barracks**: the character spent their childhood in established barracks of a king or prince, cleaning weapons, sharpening them, mending tears in cloth and leather armour, cleaning and attending livestock, and acting as a servant to soldiers. Practical training for a warrior would have been started on a formal basis and been continued into the early teens before abandoning the traditional soldier's training to gain a warrior's knowledge from direct tutors and masters.

### Progenitor

The strongest person in the character's early life who instigated the character's eventual career as a class-levelled adventurer. Usually this is the character's father and/or mother, but it could be an aunt or uncle or another mentor, depending on the [family](#family) generated above. This person's profession was experienced and lightly transferred to the character prior to advanced training as a warrior or mage; this profession often forms the character's "secondary skill" and an inspiration for any selected Skills.
