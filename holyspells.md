# Holy Spells

Holy Spells are taken directly from
[Dolmenwood](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=holy_magic),
with a few edits and exceptions as follows:

## Rank 1 Spells

### Detect Evil (St. Whittery's Vision)

_(R: 120', D: 6 Turns)_  
The caster perceives a faint halo of wicked, grinning spirits flickering around
objects under an evil enchantment and living beings with evil intentions.

- **Intent only**: The caster cannot read the thoughts of creatures with evil
  intent.
- **Definition of evil**: The Referee must judge what is classified as evil.
  Beings of Chaotic Alignment do not always have evil intent. Traps and poisons,
  while potentially harmful, are not evil.

### Detect Magic (Wisdom of St. Thorm)

_(R: 60', D: 2 Turns)_  
Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures within range of the caster are wreathed
in a shimmering, golden glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are
revealed.

### Frost Ward (St. Abthius' Rebuke)

_(R: 30', D: 6 Turns)_  
A soothing warmth comes upon all allies within range, rebuking the malicious
effects of cold and frost.

- **Normal cold**: Subjects are untroubled by non-magical freezing temperatures.
- **Save bonus**: Subjects gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws versus cold-based
  effects (e.g. magic or breath attacks).
- **Cold-based damage**: Reduce cold damage by 1 per damage die rolled. (For
  example, 4d6 damage is reduced by 4.)

### Lesser Healing (Breath of St. Lillibeth)

_(R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The fluttering of doves’ wings and the sweet scent of blossom manifest as the
caster recites this prayer. A living subject receives one of the following
ministrations:

- **Healing**: Restores 1d6+1 Hit Points. This cannot raise the subject’s Hit
  Points above the normal maximum.
- **Curing paralysis**: Paralysing effects are negated."

### Light (St. Foggarty's Benediction)

_(R: 120', D: 12 Turns)_  
A bobbing wisp of light floats from the caster’s palm and manifests one of the
following effects:

1. **Golden radiance**: Casts holy light in a 15′ radius. The light is
   sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be
   cast upon an object, in which case the golden light moves with the object.
2. **Blinding a creature**: A flash of divine light blinds a creature for the
   duration. The target may make a Willpower 14 save to resist.
3. **Cancelling magical darkness**: St Foggarty’s Benediction may cancel a 15′
   radius area of magical darkness."

### Mantle of Protection (St. Benester's Word)

_(R: Self, D: 12 Turns)_  
Invoking the name of an archangel, the caster is warded from attacks.

- **AC and Saving Throw bonus**: The caster gains a +1 Armour Class and Saving
  Throw bonus against attacks and special powers.
- **Magically created or summoned creatures**: The prayer additionally prevents
  such creatures from making melee attacks against the caster, though they may
  still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee,
  this protection is broken (though the caster still gains the Armour Class and
  Saving Throw bonuses mentioned above).

### Purify Food and Drink (St. Gretchen's Sublimation)

_(R: Touch, D: Permanent)_  
The sound of distant goat bells echoes and a quantity of poisoned, rotten,
spoiled, or contaminated food and drink is purified.

- **Quantity**: Up to 12 portions of food and drink, in any combination. 1
  ration counts as a portion of food and 1 pint counts as a portion of drink.

### Rally (St. Jorrael's Counsel)

_(R: Touch, D: 2 Turns)_  
The emboldening words of this prayer reverberate in the subject’s mind, calming
them and purging them of fear.

- **Magically induced fear**: Make a Willpower 14 saving throw with a +1 bonus
  per Level of the caster to counter magical terror. This applies to effects
  active when Rally is cast and subsequent effects during the duration.

## Rank 2 Spells

### Bless (Righteousness of St. Gondyw)

_(R: 60', D: 6 Turns)_  
Accompanied by the triumphant blaring of trumpets, a surge of divine
righteousness bolsters the morale of allies within a 20′ × 20′ area.

- **Bonuses**: Subjects gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls.
- **Retainers**: Also gain a +1 bonus to Loyalty.

### Charm Serpents (St. Dank's Plea)

_(R: 60', D: 1d4 Rounds or 1d4 Turns)_  
This prayer hypnotises snakes; the serpents rear upright and sway to and fro,
but they never attack while charmed. Number of snakes affected: Snakes whose
Levels total up to twice the caster’s Level. For example, a Level 3 caster could
affect three Level 2 snakes, two Level 3 snakes, etc. The caster selects which
individuals are affected. Duration: When cast on snakes that are already
attacking, the effect lasts for 1d4 Rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1d4 Turns.

### Find Traps (Path of St. Gripe)

_(R: 30', D: 2 Turns)_  
Trapped objects and areas within range of the caster are wreathed in an
apparition of faint, flickering flames.

- **Magical and mechanical traps**: All are revealed.
- **No disarm**: The spell provides no assistance bypassing or deactivating
  traps, only revealing their locations.

### Flame Ward (Boldness of St. Hollyhock)

_(R: 30', D: 2 Turns)_  
A puff of flour and the aroma of freshly baked bread manifest around a single
creature of the caster’s choosing, which is bestowed with supernatural
resistance to fire.

- **Normal heat**: The subject is unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
- **Save bonus**: The subject gains a +2 bonus to Saving Throws versus
  fire-based effects (e.g. magic or breath attacks). Fire-based damage: Reduce
  fire damage by 1 per damage die rolled. (For example, 4d6 damage is reduced by
  4.)

### Hold Person (St. Waylaine's Reproof)

_(R: 180', D: 9 Turns)_  
The caster castigates one or more mortals, fairies, or demi-fey for their
misdeeds, causing them to halt in their tracks if they fail a Willpower 14
saving throw. The spell may be used in two ways:

1. **Against an individual**: The target’s Saving Throw is penalised by –2.
2. **Against a group**: 1d4 individuals in the group are targeted. The
   individuals are selected by the caster.

- **Restrictions**: Large creatures are immune.
- **Paralysis**: Affected targets are aware but cannot move their limbs. They
  may, at the caster’s option, speak.
- **Freeing**: The caster may free paralysed targets with a word.

### Reveal Alignment (St. Willofrith's Warning)

_(R: 30', D: Instant)_  
An angelic voice whispers in the caster’s mind, revealing the Alignment of a
selected character, monster, object, or area within range. (Most objects and
areas do not have an Alignment, but magic items or holy places may.)

### Silence (Abjuration of St. Signis)

_(R: 180', D: 12 Turns)_  
Raising a finger to their lips, the caster whispers a hushed prayer to St Signis
the Silent. A 15′ radius area within range is shrouded in holy silence.

- **Within the area**: All sound is prevented. Conversation and spell casting
  are impossible.
- **Noise from outside**: Those within the area of silence can only hear sounds
  from outside it.
- **Casting upon a creature**: Silence may be cast upon a creature, which must
  make an Arcana 14 saving throw. If the Saving Throw fails, the shrouded 15′
  radius area of silence moves with the target. If the Saving Throw succeeds,
  the spell has no effect.

### Speak With Animals (Speech of St. Hamfast)

_(R: Self, D: 6 Turns)_  
Animals of one selected species prick up their ears to the lilting words of this
prayer. The caster can speak with all animals of that type for the duration.

- **Type of animal**: The spell translates for one species of normal or giant
  animals at a time. Intelligent animals and fantastic monsters are not
  affected.
- **Services**: Animals which are friendly towards the caster may be persuaded
  to perform a service. The service must be within an animal’s comprehension and
  capabilities.

## Rank 3 Spells

### Animal Growth (Mercy of St. Vinicus)

_(R: 120', D: 12 Turns)_  
A single animal is briefly haloed with glimmering Mithric script (the text of
this prayer), turns its eyes toward the heavens, and doubles in size.

- Damage: Double the damage of the animal’s melee attacks.
- Load: Double the maximum weight the animal can carry.
- Restrictions: This spell may be used on normal or giant animals, but
  intelligent animals, magical animals, and fantastic monsters are unaffected.

### Bless Weapon (Courage of St. Sedge)

_(R: 30', D: 1 Turn)_  
Silver light arcs from the caster’s hand and wreathes a single weapon,
enchanting it with holy power.

- Damage: The weapon deals an additional damage die.
- Treated as magical: The weapon now harms monsters which can only be harmed by
  magic.

### Cure Affliction (St. Pastery's Blessing)

_(R: 30', D: Instant)_  
The lowing of cattle can be heard as the caster recites this prayer. A living
subject receives one of the following ministrations:

1. **Cure disease**: The subject is purged of a single disease of mundane or
   magical origin.
2. **Cure blindness or deafness**: The subject’s sight or hearing are restored,
   nullifying any disease, curse, or enchantment that veiled them.

### Holy Light (Devotion of St. Eggort)

_(R: 120', D: Permanent or 6 Turns)_  
A ray of white light beams from the caster’s raised hand and manifests one of
the following effects:

1. **Eternal radiance**: Casts holy light in a 30′ radius. The light is as
   bright as full daylight (creatures that suffer penalties in daylight are
   affected). The prayer may only be cast upon a fixed location within range—the
   eternal radiance does not move. The duration is permanent.
2. **Beacon of sanctity**: White light radiates in a 15′ radius around a chosen
   object. Undead creatures suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving
   Throws while within the radius of light. The duration is 6 Turns.
3. **Cancelling magical darkness**: Devotion of St Eggort may cancel a 30′
   radius area of magical darkness.

### Locate Object (St. Keye's Revelation)

_(R: 120', D: 6 Turns)_  
A cherub-like apparition of the infant St Keye points in the direction of a
sought object, adjusting the indicated direction as the caster moves. The cherub
disappears when the sought object is within range. One of two types of objects
may be located:

1. **General class**: An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar,
   etc.). In this case, the nearest object of that type is located.
2. **Specific object**: A specific object which the caster can clearly visualise
   in all aspects. Restrictions: This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.

### Remove Curse (St. Primula's Grace)

_(R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
Milk drips from the caster’s hand as they recite this prayer. The subject,
doused in holy milk, is permanently cured of the affliction of a single curse.

- **Cursed items**: Use of this spell enables a character to discard a cursed
  magic item.

## Rank 4 Spells

### Circle of Protection (St. Faxis' Abjuration)

_(R: 10' around the caster, D: 12 Turns)_  
A sword of glowing light manifests and inscribes a 10′ radius circle around the
caster, leaving a shimmering ring of light which moves with the caster. The
caster and all allies within the circle come under the effect of a Mantle of
Protection, warded against attacks.

- **AC and Saving Throw bonus**: Those warded gain a +1 Armour Class and Saving
  Throw bonus against attacks and special powers.
- **Magically created or summoned creatures**: The prayer additionally prevents
  such creatures from making melee attacks against those warded, though they may
  still make ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a creature
  in melee, this protection is broken (those warded still gain the Armour Class
  and Saving Throw bonuses mentioned above).

### Create Water (St. Quister's Defence)

_(R: Touch, D: Permanent)_  
A magical fount of wine-red water springs forth from the ground or a wall. The
liquid looks and tastes like a sweet, refreshing wine, but it is actually pure
water.

- **Volume**: The fount produces enough to sustain 12 people and 12 mounts for
  one day (approximately 50 gallons).
- **Higher Level casters**: If the caster is higher than Level 9, water
  sufficient for an additional 12 people and mounts is produced for each Level
  beyond 9.

### Greater Healing (Steadfastness of St. Wick)

_(R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The rustic voice of St Wick manifests, whispering a parable as the caster
touches a living subject.

- **Healing**: The prayer restores 2d6+2 Hit Points to the subject. This cannot
  raise the subject’s Hit Points above the normal maximum.

### Remove Poison (St. Torphia's Respite)

_(R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The rattling of manacles echoes as a warm light envelops the caster’s hand. The
light neutralises poison in one touched creature or object.

- **Living creature**: Neutralise the effects of poison on a living subject. A
  subject that has died from poisoning can be revived (restored to 1 Hit Point)
  if Remove Poison is cast within 10 Rounds.
- **Object or substance**: Remove poison from an item, food, or liquid.

### Speak With Plants (Salvation of St. Wort)

_(R: Self, D: 3 Turns)_  
A vision of a great yew tree briefly manifests behind the caster, its limbs
arching protectively overhead. The caster gains the miraculous ability to
communicate with plants.

- **Normal plants**: Flora informs the caster of creatures that have recently
  passed or performs simple favours. For example, plants may clear a passageway
  for the caster’s party to pass through or writhe and tangle into an impassable
  thicket to hinder pursuers.
- **Monstrous plants**: The caster can communicate with plant-like or
  plant-based monsters.

### Serpent Transformation (St. Horace's Requital)

_(R: 120', D: 6 Turns)_  
Accompanied by the merry laughter of St Horace and the waft of freshly unearthed
mushrooms, 2d8 normal sticks leap to attention and miraculously transform into
adders.

- **Commands**: The snakes follow the caster’s orders for the duration of the
  spell.
- **Reversion**: When the spell ends or a snake is killed, the serpent reverts
  back to a normal stick.

**Adder** Small Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral  
Level 1 AC 13 HP 1d8 (4) Att Bite (+0, 1d3 + poison) Speed 30 Morale 7 XP 15  
Poison: Con 11 saving throw or suffer 1 damage per Round for the next 1d6
Rounds.  
When killed: The snake reverts back to a normal stick.

## Rank 5 Spells

### Communion (St. Elsa's Visitation)

_(R: Self, D: 3 Turns)_  
This prayer allows the caster to enter into communion with one of the ascended
saints, asking questions and receiving answers relaying the divine wisdom of the
One True God. The spell must be cast upon the saint’s feast day.

- **Trance**: For the duration of the spell, the caster is in a spiritual
  trance, unaware of the world around them.
- **Questions**: The caster may ask 3 questions of the saint.
- **Answers**: Each question receives a simple “yes” or “no” answer. The answers
  are guaranteed to be true.
- **Usage limit**: Communion may be cast once per week. The Referee can limit it
  to once per month if overused.
- **St Clewyd**: For theologically unclear reasons, St Clewyd does not respond
  to this spell.

### Create Food (St. Ponch's Feast)

_(R: Appears in the caster's presence, D: Permanent)_  
Barrels and hampers of fresh food wash up on a foaming swell of seawater. The
brine disappears instantly, but the food remains.

- **Volume**: Food sufficient for 12 people and 12 mounts is conjured—enough to
  last one day.
- **Higher Level casters**: If the caster is higher than Level 9, food
  sufficient for an additional 12 people and mounts is produced for each Level
  beyond 9.

### Holy Fire (St. Goodenough's Rebuke)

_(R: 30' or Self or Touch, D: Concentration up to 1 Turn or Instant)_  
A column of holy fire surrounds the caster, channelling divine grace for one of
three purposes:

1. **Circle of warding**: By concentrating and remaining stationary, the caster
   creates a ward against undead and creatures created or summoned by magic. Any
   such creature that comes within 30′ must make a Willpower 14 saving throw or
   be destroyed or banished to its place of origin. If a monster’s save
   succeeds, it flees the warded area.
2. **Target single monster**: Instantly banish or destroy a single
   magically-summoned, created, or undead creature within range. The monster may
   make a Willpower 14 saving throw (with a –2 penalty) to avoid banishment or
   destruction. If the monster’s save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
3. **Restoration**: Touching a subject instantly removes a curse, disease, or
   other affliction.

### Holy Quest (Righteousness of St. Galaunt)

_(R: 30', D: Until quest is completed)_  
Accompanied by a clap of thunder and a ray of holy light, the caster commands a
single subject to perform a specific quest or task.

- **Example quests**: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing
  a magic item to the caster, going on a journey to a holy site.
- **Suicidal quests**: The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal.
- **Refusal**: The subject must undertake the quest or suffer a –2 penalty to
  Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
- **Completion**: Once the task is completed, the spell ends.
- **Saving throw**: The subject may make a Willpower 14 saving throw to resist
  the holy compulsion, negating the effects of the spell.

### Insect Plague (Amity of St. Cornice)

_(R: 360', D: 1 Turn per Level)_  
A writhing, 60′ diameter swarm of biting insects manifests at a location within
range.

- **Movement**: The swarm does not move from the area it is summoned in.
- **Inside the swarm**: Vision is limited to 30′. Biting insects inflict 1
  damage per Round on all creatures.
- **Creatures of Level 1–2**: Low-level creatures caught within the swarm flee
  in horror and only stop when at least 240′ away.

### Raise Dead (Mercy of St. Clewyd)

_(R: 120', D: Instant)_  
The ultimate miracle—by the grace of God, a deceased person may be returned to
life.

- **Restrictions**: Mortals may be raised. Fairies and demi-fey may not, the
  fate of their souls being outside of the purview of the Pluritine Church.
- **Ritual**: Raise Dead requires a grandiose ritual in a cathedral (e.g. in
  Castle Brackenwold), the participation of a dozen priests, and the burning of
  rare incenses to the value of 2,000gp. Despite its title, the ritual makes no
  reference to St Clewyd.
- **Time limit**: A person deceased for no longer than 2 days per Level of the
  caster can be raised. (e.g. a Level 10 caster can revive someone who has been
  dead up to 20 days.)
- **Weakness**: Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets 2 full
  weeks of bed rest, they have 1 Hit Point, move at half Speed, cannot carry
  heavy items, and cannot attack, cast spells, make Skill Checks, or use other
  Class capabilities. Recovery from this weakness cannot be hastened by magic of
  any kind.
