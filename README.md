| 18      | +2            | 7     | 10      |

## Note Your XP Bonus (If Any)

+5% XP (cumulative) bonus for each of the following: Prime Requisite(s) 13+, Wis 13+, Cha 13+.

## Choose Alignment

Druids must start as Neutral; Paladins & Rangers must be Lawful; Thieves must be Neutral or Chaotic; Clerics must be Lawful or Chaotic.

- **Lawful (1-3)**: You believe in goodness, justice, truth, and order; will protect others; act for the good of the group.
- **Neutral (4-5)**: You believe in balance, will cooperate if there's no drawback, treat others like they treat you.
- **Chaotic (6)**: Evil rules, law drools. Screw these shmucks.

## Buy Equipment
Roll 8d6 and multiply the number by 10. That’s your starting silver pieces (sp).

We’re using “item slot” encumbrance. Most things are 1 slot, but 2h weapons and medium armor are 2, heavy armor is 3, and coins & gems stack to 500 in a slot. If you cross the line marked on your character sheet, you’re encumbered.

If you’re a cleric, be sure to buy a holy symbol! If you’re a thief, you’ll want lockpicks. A magic-user needs a book to use as a spellbook.

Make a note on your sheet which slots belong to which containers you have (backpack, sacks, etc.). Small sacks require one hand to carry, large sacks require two hands.

## Note Your Movement Speed

The first number is your exploration speed, the second is your speed in combat.

| Armor Worn               | Unencumbered   | Encumbered     |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Unarmored, Leather       | 120' (40')     | 90' (30')      |
| Ring, Scale, Chainmail   | 90' (30')      | 60' (20')      |
| Splint, Plate            | 60' (20')      | 30' (10')      |

## Check Any Special Abilities You Have

- **Awareness**: Rangers are only surprised on a roll of 1-in-6. A ranger may be able to act in the surprise round while their companions are surprised.
- **Backstab**: When attacking with surprise from behind, the Thief gains +4 to hit and inflicts double damage.
- **Fighting the Unskilled**: Against creatures with 1 hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round.
- **Foraging & Hunting:** A party with a ranger succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and is twice as effective while hunting.
- **Identification:** Druids can identify all plants and animals and can discern pure water.
- **Laying on Hands**: A Paladin can "lay on hands" once per day to cure 2hp per Paladin level.
- **Limited Possessions:** Rangers travel light and may not keep more treasure than they (or their steed) can carry.
- **Paladin Vows**: Paladins may own 1 suit of magic armor, 1 magic shield, and 1 magical melee weapon, but no more than 4 additional magic items. Paladins must give away 10% of any treasure received to some Lawful Good cause.
- **Parry**: Fighters with a Dexterity score of 13 or better can parry instead of attacking to penalize incoming attacks at the following rate: Dex 13-15=-1 to hit, Dex 16-17=-2 to hit, Dex 18=-3 to hit. (Declared during declaration phase.)
- **Protection from Evil**: A Paladin radiates an aura within a 10' radius, equivalent to the clerical spell *protection from evil*.
- **Ranger Stealth:** In the wilderness, a ranger has a 3-in-6 chance of hiding and a 3-in-6 chance of moving silently.
- **Strength Bonuses:** Only fighters receive bonuses to hit and to damage based on their Str score.
- **Thieving Skills**: You're preternaturally good at some things. Roll the number listed or lower on 1d20 to succeed. At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have 12 points to add to your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). You'll also add your Dex mod to * skills. If you wear armor other than padded or leather while attempting the * skills or Climb Walls, you have a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes. Note: These Thieving Skills are also modified by your race.
  -   *Pick Pockets: 3
  -   *Open Locks: 2
  -   *Find/Remove Traps: 1
  -   *Move Silently: 2
  -   *Hide in Shadows: 1
  -   Climb Walls: 12
  -   Detect Noise: 3
  -   Read Languages: 0
- **Tracking**: Rangers are able to track other creatures, with a starting base chance of 20% (modifiers in full rules).
- **Turn Undead**: Clerics present their holy symbol in an attempt to "turn" the undead, causing the foul monsters to flee. Roll 2d6, and if the number is equal to or greater than the number below, 2d6 creatures of the targeted type are turned and depart, not returning for 3d4 rounds: Skeleton (7), Zombie (9), Ghoul (11).

## If You're A Magic-User, Roll for Spells

Read Magic & Detect Magic will always be your first spells; the rest will be random. See the list at right. At level 1, you can memorize one of your spells each day to cast. Also, add a spellbook to your inventory.

| Int     | Starting Spells   | Int     | Starting Spells   |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 3-8     | 2                 | 15-16   | 5                 |
| 9-12    | 3                 | 17      | 6                 |
| 13-14   | 4                 | 18      | 7                 |

## Magic-User 1<sup>st</sup> Level Starting Spells

Note that you can learn many more spells than this! These are just the "basics" any self-respecting Magic-User might be expected to know.

1. **Charm Person.** Target thinks you're their bestie and might do what you say. Lasts longer vs dumb targets.
2. **Detect Magic.** You see nearby enchanted stuff glow for 2 turns.
3. **Hold Portal**: Keep a door closed for 2d6 turns.
4. **Light**: 15' radius light cast on an object or eyeballs (it'll blind a baddie!). Lasts 6 turns + 1 per level.
5. **Magic Missile**: Auto-hit for 1d6+1 damage. More missiles as you level.
6. **Protection from Evil**: Against creatures of another alignment, you get +1 to saving throws and they get -1 to attack you for 6 turns. Enchanted, constructed, and summoned creatures can't touch you.
7. **Read Languages**: You can read any written language for 2 turns.
8. **Read Magic**: For 1 turn, you can read magical scrolls, spellbooks, & inscriptions not written by you. Once you've read something once, you can read it again without recasting this spell.
9. **Shield**: A frontal shield that gives you AC 17 vs missile attacks, and AC 15 vs other attacks. *Magic missiles* can't penetrate it.
10. **Sleep**: Magically puts creatures to sleep, either one 4+1HD creature or 2d8 hit dice of creatures of 4HD
or lower each.

## Note a Motivation or Motto

*Why is your character risking their life for adventure? This can be one word, or a short sentence. Examples:*

- Rejected from his clan, Gorend is on a mission to prove himself.
- Percival always has to be the hero.
- Cedric can't resist a good story.
- Spread the faith
- Earn glory
- Amass wealth
- Take revenge
- Master a skill
- Obey duty
- Discover truth
- Do good
- Help others
- Instill chaos

# How to Play

## Combat
**Attacking from Behind:** There are only two ways for most people to get behind someone during combat. One is to surprise an opponent and attack from behind during the surprise action. The other is to attack an opponent from behind when an ally is attacking from the front. Thieves and Assassins can get behind a target during normal combat if they successfully hide in shadows, even if no one is attacking the target from the front.

**Blocking:** A defender effectively blocks an area about five feet across, and enemies cannot move through this area without first killing the defender.

**Cover:** Cover bonuses are as follows: 25% cover: +1 AC; 50% cover: +2 AC; 75% cover: +3 AC; 90% cover +4 AC. Firing into a melee is considered 50% cover if firing past a dwarf or halfling, and 90% cover if firing past a human, elf, or half-elf.

**Damage & Death:** When a character’s hit points reach 0, the character is unconscious and must make a saving throw. On a failure, the character dies. On a success, the character will die in 1d4 rounds, rolled in secret by the referee, unless magically healed or aided by another player character. Each PC may attempt to aid once, succeeding on a 1-in-6 chance.

Even after returning to 1 or more hp, the character will remain in a coma for 1d6 turns and must rest for a minimum of one week before resuming any sort of strenuous activity, mental or physical.

Characters who are slain may be raised from the dead if a Cleric of sufficient level is available to perform the casting. Each time a character is brought back from the dead, their CON score is reduced by one point.

**Grappling:** The attackers (or attacker) make individual to-hit rolls. The grapple is resolved among those who hit: Each combatant rolls their total hit dice. If the sum of the attackers’ dice is higher than the defender’s total, the defender is completely pinned and can be killed in the next round unless help arrives or the defender wins initiative and breaks loose. If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling, and none of them can attack with a weapon. If the defender wins, the
attackers are beaten back and stunned for a number of rounds equal to the number of points by which the defender beat them. Breaking free of a grapple requires another HD contest.

**Invisible Opponents:** Attacks against an invisible opponent have a –4 penalty. Powerful magical monsters, or monsters with more than 11 hit dice, will usually be able to see invisible creatures normally. 

**Order of Combat:** All combat phases for a side take place simultaneously and are resolved in whatever order that side desires.

**Prone or Stunned Opponent:** Attacks against a prone or stunned opponent negate shield & Dex bonuses to AC, and melee attacks are made at +4 to hit.

**Spacing & the Second Rank:** Only daggers, shortswords, spears, and polearms can be used three-abreast in a 10’ area. All other one-handed weapons require five feet of room (two-abreast in a 10’ area), and non-thrusting two-handed weapons require a full 10’ space to wield.

Spears and polearms in the second rank of a battle formation can attack by reaching through the first rank.

**Two-Handed Weapons and Two-Weapon Fighting:** Fighting two-handed grants a +1 to damage rolls (except for weapons that can only be used two-handed, where this is already taken into account in the weapon’s damage), and fighting with an eligible weapon in each hand gives a +1 to hit.

**Life Energy Levels & Level Drain:** If a drained character is multi-classed or dual-classed, then the highest level of experience attained by that character is lost. If the character has two equal levels, then the level lost should be determined randomly.

## Dual-Classing

Dual-classed characters are humans who elect to change irrevocably from one class to another. In order to change class, the character must have a minimum attribute score of 16 in the Prime Requisite of the new class, and must qualify in terms of normal ability score requirements and alignment restrictions.

The character retains his or her hit points. He or she can use the particular abilities of the original class, but doing so will cause the character to forfeit all experience points from that adventure (as determined by the referee). This restriction applies until the character has advanced in the new class to a level at least one higher than was attained in the original class.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, he or she gains the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class, and all experience is applied to progressing in the new class. The character gains no additional hit points until reaching a level in the new class one higher than in the original class, after which time the character's hit points advance as per the new class. A dual-classed character can never gain more than 9 full hit dice, no matter how many total levels are gained.

Unlike multi-class characters, dual-classed characters cannot perform the functions of several different classes simultaneously. So, for example, an elven Fighter/Magic-User could cast arcane spells while wearing armor, but a human dual-classed Fighter and Magic-User would have to remove his or her armor to do the same thing.

## Dungeon Exploration

**Listening at Doors:** Takes 1 turn of straining in utter silence to hear subtle sounds beyond a closed door (or down a hallway).

**Mapping:** Maps are usually best made simply: boxes and lines are sufficient to keep you from getting lost. The players' map represents an actual in-game object. If the players at the table are making a map, then a character must also be making one. This has several corollaries: the party must have light (they can only map what they see) and mapping supplies (something to write with and something to write on), they must be moving slowly and methodically (no more than standard exploration speed), and measuring the size of a room takes time. Perhaps most importantly, if something happens to the map in-game, it happens to the players' map as well! If the mapping character dies and his or her body is left behind, if the characters are captured and stripped of their equipment, or if a jet of acid or a green slime destroys the map, the referee should confiscate it. If the party wants backup copies, the players must actually draw them. If the entire party dies in the dungeon, the only way their maps will survive is if copies were left on the surface.

**Open a Stuck or Locked Door:** Upon discovering that a door is stuck, a character may make an open doors check to pull the door open as swiftly and quietly as possible. Each character may only try once. On a failure, the party may decide to work with crowbars or other tools to wrench the door open anyway. This takes a turn and will trigger a wandering monster check. Locked doors need keys, Thieves' tools and a Thief, or a battering ram (or axes). Any failed attempt to open a stuck or locked door will prevent surprise on any creature on the other side of the door. You should also know: Doors tend to close on their own. Iron spikes are invaluable for keeping doors open or closed.

Search for Traps or Secret Doors: It's usually best to do this free-form and narratively (tell the referee what you're doing to search). A careful examination of a 10'x10' area or 10' section of wall takes one turn. Multiple characters can search/examine different areas simultaneously. There's a 2-in-6 standard chance of success (4-in-6 for elves and 3-in-6 for half-elves).

## Equipment Wear & Tear

Equipment can be worn down! If you are hit by an attack where the attacker rolled a 20, your armor gains a **notch** of damage. Each notch reduces your AC total by 1. Weapons gain a notch when you roll a 1 on an attack with them. Each weapon notch reduces by one step the damage die you roll with that weapon (i.e. d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > 1).

Items can be repaired by an appropriate craftsman, costing 10% of the item's original price per notch. Armor and weapons can take no more than 10 notches of damage before they're destroyed.

Magic weapons and armor take ½ notches instead of full notches.

## Falling

Damage from falling is determined as follows: Falls of less than 5 ft do no damage in game terms, falls of up to 10 ft cause 1d6 damage, falls of up to 20 ft cause 3d6 damage, falls of up to 30 ft cause 6d6, 40 ft is 10d6, 50 ft is 15d6, and falls of over 50 ft cause 20d6 points of damage.

## Fighter Changes

**Bonus Attacks:** Fighters with melee weapons attack once per round at 1st to 6th levels (1/1 attacks); at 7th to 12th levels, they attack thrice every two rounds (3/2 attacks); and at 13th or higher levels they attack twice per round (2/1 attacks). A partial additional attack (e.g. 3/2 attacks) means that the extra attack is taken on odd-numbered rounds in the combat sequence, hence two attacks on the first round, one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth, if applicable.

**Fighting the Unskilled:** Against creatures with 1 (8-sided) hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round. A Fighter exercising multiple attacks departs from the normal initiative procedure. The Fighter will automatically attack first in the round unless fighting an opponent with multiple attacks of its own (in which case initiative should be rolled as normal). The Fighter’s second attack in any given melee round will come in their usual place, and any further attacks will come last in the sequence.

**High Level Auto-Hit:** If a Fighter of extremely high level or with many bonuses “to hit” actually requires a negative roll to hit his or her target, the negative number needed may be converted to a positive and applied as additional damage to the automatic hit. Thus, for example, a 14th level Fighter with 18 strength and a +5 sword has a total to-hit bonus of +20. Against an AC 18 dragon, this would be an automatic hit plus 2 additional damage (20 to-hit – AC 18).

## Gaining Experience & Levels

You gain experience primarily through recovering treasure and then **spending it**. 1sp spent = 1XP. A Paladin’s required charity tithe does not obtain this XP, nor does sp spent on mundane equipment or on monthly upkeep costs. Money spent on acquiring retainers and repairing equipment does count towards XP. In general, you can flavor this spending as martial training, carousing, philanthropy, greasing palms, investing in local faction relations, or any number of other in-world expenditures, limited only by your imagination.

A character receives 1 XP per 2sp spent **constructing a stronghold** to secure a domain. The XP is earned when the stronghold is completed. If the character ever loses the stronghold, the XP earned from its construction is lost. This may result in the loss of class levels. The character can regain the lost XP by retaking the stronghold intact. If the stronghold is partially destroyed when re-captured, the character regains XP equal to its reduced value.

A character may earn XP from **domain and mercantile income** if the activity was managed by the character personally and if the net income earned in any month exceeds the character’s monthly sp threshold (see table below). Domain and mercantile funds must be tracked separately from “normal” adventuring funds and from each other. If domain or mercantile income exceeds the character’s sp threshold, the character earns XP equal to the difference.

A character may earn XP from **magical research** or magic item creation if the research was conducted by the character personally and if the cost exceeds the character’s sp threshold (see table below). The XP is earned when the research is completed, based on its monthly cost (always calculated as at least one month, even if the research only takes a week). If this monthly cost exceeds the character’s sp threshold, the character earns XP equal to the difference per month of research. Failing at magical research does earn XP.

| Class Level  | sp Threshold  |

Each new dungeon room or hex **explored and mapped** grants (10 x Dungeon Level) XP (or 10 x number of hexes from the nearest known settlement XP) per character. Each hex or room past the fifth in a given delve or adventure begins to grant cumulative XP (i.e. room #6=20XP x Dungeon Level, room #7=30XP x Dungeon Level, etc.). Once the party returns to safety to heal and restock, the counter resets. A room can only be “explored” once, ever. 

## Healing

A character will recover 1hp by resting overnight in a safe and comfortable location, and 1d3 hp per day of uninterrupted rest. 30 days of rest will return any character to full hp.

## Light & Vision

A party needs one light source for approximately every three members of the party. For every missing light source, PCs incur a -1 penalty to attack, up to -4. Note that light sources can be seen from much further away than the illumination they shed for those holding them. Approaching light will warn intelligent creatures of the approach of surface-dwellers, perhaps giving them a chance to prepare.

## Magic & Spells

**Creating Magic Items:** Potions are created by alchemists, with the more powerful potions usually requiring the help of a Magic-User. A Magic-User seeking to create potions must employ an alchemist. A Magic-User must be 9th level to create potions on their own, and 11th level to create other magic items.

**Memorizing Spells:** Spell memorization requires a minimum rest period of 4 hours, which must be spent in a quiet place without interruption. Once this period has expired, it takes fifteen minutes per level to memorize spells; in other words, a character memorizing one 3rd, two 2nd and four 1st level spells would require a further (45+30+30+15+15+15+15=) two hours and forty-five minutes of memorization time. Spells, once cast, are lost from the casting character's memory and cannot be reused until the caster memorizes them again. (Exception: It is possible to memorize the same spell twice or even more times if the caster has sufficient spell slots.)

**Scribing Scrolls:** Scrolls may be created by Clerics or Magic-Users at a cost of 500sp per level of the spell, and require a full week of work for each spell level. Magically-infused inks brewed by alchemists are the main component of this cost, and these may not be readily available outside large cities. A character cannot scribe a scroll based off another scroll.

**Spell Scrolls:** It is not possible to memorize a spell from a scroll, although magic users may copy the spell from the scroll into their spell books, if they understand the spell. This process always erases the scroll. This is the primary means by which magic users will acquire new spells for their spell books.

Alternatively, the spell may be cast directly from the scroll, in which case the scroll is erased as the spell is cast. In this case, it is not necessary for the caster to know the spell beforehand, and indeed it is possible to cast a spell from a scroll even if the caster does not know the spell or is of insufficient level to use the magic.

In extreme cases (such as when a character casts a spell from a scroll well above the level he or she could normally memorize) the referee will assign a chance that the spell will fail.

A character must be of the correct class to cast a spell from a scroll. Thus, only Clerics or Paladins may cast spells from clerical scrolls, only Druids or Rangers from druidic ones, and so on. (Exception: Thieves may attempt to cast arcane and phantasmal spells from scrolls.)

## Magic-User Changes

**Acquiring New Spells:** A Magic-User will automatically receive one new spell of the highest level he or she may cast when reaching a new level of spell (i.e. upon reaching 3rd level, the Magic-User will automatically receive one 2nd-level spell; upon reaching 5th level, one 3rd-level spell). The rest must be found and copied into the mage’s spellbook from dungeons or musty libraries in the world, or painstakingly researched.

To copy a spell from a scroll (or spellbook), the mage must first be able to read the spell (i.e. by casting read magic). If the mage understands the spell (see table below), he or she may then transcribe the spell into his or her own spellbook, which takes 1 hour per level of the spell. If the spell is on a scroll, this process always erases the scroll. If the roll to understand the spell fails, the Magic-User may attempt to understand it again if a) they gain a level, or b) they come across a different instance of the spell. To research a new spell, the player should describe in detail the spell they wish to create and the effects it has. The referee will then decide if the spell can be created and, if so, what the spell level will be. The Magic-User and Illusionist spells in OSE are “pre-approved” and have been invented in the world already. To research, the Magic-User must spend two weeks and 2,000sp per level of the spell. If the research fails (see the table), the money and time invested are lost. Future attempts require half the money and time investment (i.e. 2nd try: 1 week+ 1,000sp per spell level, 3rd try: 3 days+500sp, etc.).

| Intelligence Score | Chance to Understand Spells | Chance of Successful Research |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 9                  | 35%                         | 40%                           |
| 10-12              | 45%                         | 50%                           |
| 13-14              | 55%                         | 70%                           |
| 15-16              | 65%                         | 75%                           |
| 17                 | 75%                         | 85%                           |
| 18                 | 85%                         | 90%                           |
| 19+                | 90%                         | 95%                           |

**Creating Magical Items:** Magic-Users can create spell scrolls at any level.

**Understanding Spells:** A Magic-User can understand a limited number of spells per level, based on his or her Intelligence score (see Character Creation pages). For example, a Magic-User of 3rd level with an Intelligence of 14 can understand and have in his or her spellbook a maximum of 24 spells in total. 

## Multi-Classing

The following clarifications apply to the rules for Multiple Classes on pg. 15 of OSE Advanced.

Multi-classing is available only to non-human characters. 

Cleric/Fighters may use edged weapons. Fighter/Magic-Users may cast spells while armored. Wearing armor other than padded or leather while attempting * Thief skills incurs a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes.

Any experience points received are divided evenly among all the classes of a multi-classed character and tracked separately, even when the character can no longer advance in one or more classes.

Multi-classed characters do not receive bonuses to experience points, regardless of their Attribute scores.

The saving throw of a multi-classed character is the best available from the different choices, including any bonuses from a character class.

## NPC Spellcasting

Non-player characters may be hired to cast spells or perform other services. As a rough guideline, the cost for an NPC spellcaster to perform such service is often sp equal to 10% of the XP required for a caster to attain the level needed to cast the spell (e.g. *raise dead* requires a Cleric to attain 7<sup>th</sup> level, which takes 55,000XP, so the spell would cost 5,500sp).

Sages not employed by a PC will often charge around 100sp to identify a potion, or 200sp to identify a magical item.

## Retainers

Retainers cost 50sp on initial hire (+50sp to request a class), plus ½ share of treasure. Will be level 1d3, but cannot be higher than the hiring PC’s level.

Loyalty is checked after each adventure/session. If a success is rolled, the retainer’s loyalty increases by one to a maximum of 11. On a failure, the retainer departs. 

Porters/torchbearers come with no equipment.  Equipment purchased by the PC is kept by the PC. Retainers come with a starting equipment pack: a backpack, tinderbox, waterskin, rations x3, torches x3, 3d6sp, and the following:

- Armor based on class. Magic-Users have no armor or shield (but get 4d6sp). Thief & Druid get leather armor. Others roll 1d6:
  - 1-2=Leather (AC 12)
  - 3-4=Ring (AC 13)
  - 5=Scale (AC 14)
  - 6=Chainmail (AC 15)
- Choose a weapon option (Clerics can only wield blunt weapons; Druids only wooden; Magic-Users only daggers, staves & darts; dwarves & halflings can't use large two-handed weapons):
  - Option A: One melee weapon & a shield (+1 AC)
  - Option B: One two-handed weapon (+1 damage)
  - Option C: Two one-handed weapons (+1 to hit)
  - Option D: One melee weapon & one ranged weapon (plus ammo)
- Roll 1d12 twice on the gear table below.
- Go shopping with your 3d6sp, if you want.
  - Clerics will need a holy symbol; thieves need thieves' tools; magic-users need a book to serve as their spellbook.

## Adventuring Gear Table

| 1d12 | Gear                          | 1d12 | Gear                          |
|------|-------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|

| 6    | Pole, 10'                     | 12   | Wolfsbane sprig              |

## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or higher than the character's saving throw target number, the saving throw succeeds.

Monster Saving Throws are as follows:

| Hit Dice   | Saving Throw |
|------------|--------------|
| <1 HD      | 18           |
| 1 HD       | 17           |
| 2 HD       | 16           |
| 3 HD       | 14           |
| 4 HD       | 13           |
| 5 HD       | 12           |
| 6 HD       | 11           |
| 7 HD       | 9            |
| 8 HD       | 8            |
| 9 HD       | 6            |
| 10 HD      | 5            |
| 11 HD      | 4            |
| 12+ HD     | 3            |

## Strongholds & Domains

Strongholds and domains are as in OSE Advanced, with clarifications and detailed procedures as in [ACKS](https://alexmooney.github.io/ACKS_SRD/Chapter07.html#strongholds-and-domains).

## Thief Changes

**Backstab:** When attacking with surprise, from behind, with a melee weapon, the attack is made at +4 to hit and inflicts double damage. At levels 6-8, damage is tripled; at levels 9-12, damage is quadrupled; at level 13+, damage is quintupled. Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied.

**Thieving Skills:** Thieves are preternaturally good at certain skills. Roll the number listed or lower on a 1d20 to succeed. Add your Dex mod to * skills. At 1st level, you have 12 points to distribute among your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). At each level, you gain an additional 6 points to distribute (no more than 3 to a single skill each level). No skill can be raised above 19, including adjustments for dexterity, race, and armor. The referee will always roll Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, and Detect Noise checks. The starting values are as follows:

- *Pick Pockets: 3
- *Open Locks: 2
- *Find/Remove Traps: 1
- *Move Silently: 2
- *Hide in Shadows: 1
- Climb Walls: 12
- Detect Noise: 3
- Read Languages: 0
      
- **Pick Pockets:** If the Thief’s pick pockets check fails by 4 or more, then his or her attempt has been discovered and the intended victim will almost always take hostile action.
- **Open Locks:** Thieves can pick any mechanical locking mechanism requiring keys and/or finesse to unlock. Picking a lock takes 1 turn. Failure indicates the attempt is impossible until the Thief increases in experience level. Picking locks requires suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the referee.
- **Find/Remove Traps:** Thieves’ expertise with small, complex mechanisms allows them to find and remove treasure traps or other small traps with accessible mechanics. Other classes do not have the expertise to attempt this feat. On a dice roll of 20 the trap is automatically sprung. Removing or disarming a trap requires suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the referee. Thieves can detect and remove magical traps, but the chance of success is halved. PCs of all classes may try to find or remove any trap by describing their actions (e.g. poking a dagger in a lock, pouring water over a floor, etc.). In this way, it is possible to find, bypass, or disable traps without a roll. 
- **Move Silently:** Thieves have the skill to move completely silently. A Thief who fails their roll to move silently is still assumed to be moving quietly; thus, the normal surprise rules apply.
- **Hide in Shadows:** Some shadow must be present for this ability to be used, but if the check is successful the Thief is effectively invisible until he makes an attack or moves from the shadows. The ability can also be used to blend in with a crowd of people rather than disappear into shadows. Infravision does not reveal a hidden Thief.
- **Climb Walls:** A Thief can scale sheer walls and surfaces without any gear, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. The check is normally repeated every 10 feet.
- **Detect Noise:** Replaces Listening at Doors and its base 1-in-6 chance (2-in-6 chance for elves & halflings).
- **Read Languages:** The Thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.

# Wilderness Exploration

Each day, roll 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d12, 1d100.

## 1. Check for Encounters

**1d6** for encounter chance:

- City, clear, grassland, settled		1-in-6
- Air, barren, forest, hills, ocean, river, desert			2-in-6
- Jungle, mountains, swamp		3-in-6

If there's an encounter, 1d100 roll on the appropriate encounter table.

**1d8** for lair (1), tracks (2), or normal (3-8)

**1d4** for Encounter time: Morning (4a-10a), Daytime (10a-4p), Evening (4p-10p), Night (10p-4a)

## 2. Check for Lost Chance - 1d12 (1d10 in adverse conditions)

| 1d12 | Clear, Grasslands |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3-12 | Not lost |

| 1d12 | Barren, Hills, Forest, Mountains |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3 | Veer 2 hexes clockwise |
| 4 | Veer 2 hexes counterclockwise |
| 5-12 | Not lost |

| 1d12 | Desert, Jungle, Swamp |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3 | Veer 2 hexes clockwise |
| 4 | Veer 2 hexes counterclockwise |
| 5 | Move backwards 1 hex |
| 6 | Lose a day of travel |
| 7-12 | Not lost |

## 3. Loop: Describe Surroundings & Decide Direction

PCs have "movement points" (MP) equal to miles per day (per-turn move rate/5, in miles) divided by hex size:

| Armour | Normal | Encumbered |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Unarmored | 4 | 3 | 
| Light | 3 | 2 |
| Heavy | 2 | 1 |

*+1 MP if on a road all day*

Each hex costs a number of MP to move **into**. Clear = 1, Rough = 2, Very Rough = 3. One MP may "roll over" to the next day, and PCs may "force march" to gain 1 additional MP, but must rest the next full day.

## 4. Check foraging (1-in-6), mark off supplies, mark off calendar

# Camping in the Wilds

## Building a Fire

Given a means of producing flame (e.g. a tinderbox, magic) and a stash of wood (either gathered from the forest or carried in packs), a character may attempt to build a fire.

**Good conditions:** In favourable conditions, with decent wood and a relatively dry campsite, fire-building automatically succeeds.

**Bad conditions:** In more troublesome circumstances, the basic chance of the party successfully getting a fire going is 4-in-6, though "Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind" and will automatically succeed. However, the referee may reduce the chance of success to account for extreme cold or damp.

## Fetching Water

Finding water to drink is assumed to always be successful unless in an exceptionally dry environment, when it is only found while successfully foraging. 

## Cooking

Given a fire, cooking pots, and ingredients (e.g. foraged food, standard rations, hunted game), someone may cook a meal. The cook should make a WIS or DEX check. 

**If the check succeeds:** An especially tasty dish is produced. Those who eat the meal gain a +1 bonus to any CON checks required to rest (see below), due to their hearty supper.

**If the check fails:** A palatable but not exemplary dish is produced. A natural 20 denotes a ruined meal (burned, spilled, etc.) that is utterly inedible.

## Camaraderie

Time spent around the fireside with one’s companions may lift the spirits and induce restful sleep. A character may attempt to entertain their comrades with music, song, stirring tales, jokes, and so forth. The character should make a CHA check.

**If the check succeeds:** All characters gain a +1 bonus to any CON checks required to rest (see below).

**If the check fails:** The attempt to entertain falls flat and may lead to ridicule or discord.

## Rest Checks

When camping in the wild, characters’ ability to get a good night’s rest is determined by their equipment (whether they have a bedroll and/or tent), their warmth (whether they have a fire burning), and the season. See the Sleeping in the Wilds table. Non-ideal circumstances require PCs to make a CON check. 

**If the check succeeds:** The character gets a good night’s sleep and regains 1hp overnight.

**If the check fails:** The character fails to get a good night’s sleep and suffers the following penalties: 

- Hit point loss: If the character’s current hit point total is greater than 1, they suffer 1 point of damage, due to fatigue.
- Difficulty memorizing spells: For each spell the character attempts to memorize, there is a 1-in-6 chance of failure. If the roll fails, the character is unable to memorize this spell—the spell memorization slot remains empty.

## Sleeping in the Wilds

| Fire     | Bed             | Winter            | Spring            | Summer            | Autumn            |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| No fire  | No bedding      | Automatic failure | 2x CON check      | CON check         | 2x CON check      |
| No fire  | Bedroll or tent | Automatic failure | CON check         | Good night's rest | CON check         |
| No fire  | Bedroll & tent  | 2x CON check      | CON check         | Good night's rest | CON check         |
| Campfire | No bedding      | Automatic failure | 2x CON check      | CON check         | 2x CON check      |
| Campfire | Bedroll or tent | 2x CON check      | Good night's rest | Good night's rest | Good night's rest |
| Campfire | Bedroll & tent  | CON check         | Good night's rest | Good night's rest | Good night's rest |

# Hirelings 

## Standard Hirelings

Short-term services of simple craftsmen and laborers are relatively easily procured, but it is harder to find individuals willing to take service for longer than a few days, especially if considerable travel is involved.

| Hireling | Daily Rate | Monthly Rate |
|---------------------------------------|------|-------|
| Carpenter, Mason, Servant             | 11sp | 200sp |
| Groom, Laborer, Linkboy, Pack Handler | 6sp  | 120sp |
| Cook, Leatherer, Tailor               | 10sp | 200sp |
| Limner                                | 9sp  | 180sp |
| Teamster                              | 7sp  | 140sp |

**Carpenter**: Skilled in the working of wood, a carpenter might be retained to construct anything from a table to a palisade. Their expertise is also invaluable for the manufacturing of shields and similar items.

**Cook**: Familiar with the preparation of various types of food, and sometimes also knows a little herblore.

**Groom**: Proficient in the care of horses, an attentive groom can usually tell a good mount from a bad; also known as an ostler or stable hand.

**Laborer**: Essentially unskilled, laborers are suitable for only the most menial sorts of work; this category includes bearers and porters, each of which is able to carry up to 12 slots of items, or twice that if a pole or other contrivance is utilized.

**Leatherer**: Capable of producing a wide range of leather goods, such as packs, belts or riding gear; a leatherer is indispensable for the making of scabbards, sheathes, shields and the other leather components of arms and armor.

**Limner**: Adept in the painting of signs and the illumination of heraldic devices, among other similar tasks.

**Linkboy**: Usually hired to bear a lantern or torch, a linkboy is typically (but not always) a youth.

**Mason**: Expert in the working of stone or plaster, masons are essential for the construction of many significant buildings and fortifications.

**Pack Handler:** Practiced in the burdening, handling and unburdening of various pack animals.

**Servant**: Typically serving as valets, butlers, maids, messengers or simple lackeys, servants are expected to look to the needs of their master.

**Tailor**: Accomplished in the repair and making of clothes or other cloth items; the services of a tailor are also required for the production of various types of textile based armor and coverings.

**Teamster**: Experienced drivers of carts and wagons, teamsters are usually experts at loading and unloading their vehicles, as well as handling the animals with which they are familiar.

## Mercenaries/Men-at-Arms

Mercenaries are as on pgs. 112-113 of *OSE Advanced.* The majority of regular men-at-arms are zero-level characters with 1d4+3 hit points. The following additional mercenaries are available (and in some cases required):

**Captain**: Equivalent to a 5th- to 8th-level fighter (1-4=5th, 5-7=6th, 8-9=7th, 0=8th). A captain may lead 20 men at arms and one lieutenant per level of experience, plus any necessary sergeants; the monthly wage demanded by a captain is equal to his level x 100sp.

**Lieutenant**: Equivalent to a 2nd- (1-7) or 3rd- (8-0) level fighter. A lieutenant may lead ten men at arms per level of experience, plus any necessary sergeants. A lieutenant serving under a captain extends the number of troops the captain can effectively command and control. The monthly wage demanded by a lieutenant is equal to his level x 100sp.

**Sergeant**: Equivalent to a 1st-level fighter. A sergeant can lead up to ten men independently or in service to a lieutenant or captain. In any given company, there must be one sergeant for every five to ten men at arms. The monthly wage required by a sergeant is ten times that of the troop type he leads.

A player character fighter of the appropriate level may serve as a sergeant, lieutenant or captain, as might an allied non-player character fighter or retainer. A character of a related class, such as ranger or paladin, might also suffice if the circumstances warrant.

## Expert Hirelings/Specialists

Obtaining the services of very skilled craftsmen and other professional servitors typically involves the expenditure of considerable time and resources. Whilst it is possible to retain such hirelings for short periods, few will agree to a term of less than a month and most expect to serve considerably longer.

| Specialist | Monthly Wage |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Alchemist                   | 1,000sp |
| Animal Trainer              | 500sp   |
| Armorer                     | 500sp\* |
| Blacksmith                  | 220sp   |
| Engineer (Architect)        | 500sp\* |
| Engineer (Artillerist)      | 300sp   |
| Engineer (Miner or Sapper)  | 300sp   |
| Jeweler/Gemcutter           | 200sp\* |
| Sage                        | Special |
| Scribe                      | 200sp   |
| Ship Crew                   | 120sp   |
| Ship Captain                | 500sp   |
| Spy                         | Special |
| Steward/Castellan           | Special |
| Weaponsmith                 | 300sp\* |

*\*Cost does not include all remuneration or special fees.*

**Alchemist**: Identify potions and substances. Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see _OSE Advanced, Magical Research, p126_). An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.

**Animal Trainer**: Specialized trainers are required for exotic animals or larger numbers of normal animals. A trainer can have up to six animals under their care at a time. It will take a minimum of one uninterrupted month to teach an animal the first new behavior or trick. After this first month, an animal has become accustomed to the trainer and can be taught additional behaviors at twice the rate (two weeks per behavior).

**Armorer**: Required for the production and maintenance of armor and shields; for every 60 men at arms or barded warhorses present, there must be at least one armorer available. Each must be provided with a workroom, forge, and assistants at an additional cost (~400sp). An armorer can use spare time (prorated based on number of supported troops) to make additional armor, helmets, or shields at 25% of their usual cost. Per month, an armorer can make three shields or one suit of armor.

**Blacksmith:** Essential for the basic maintenance of a stronghold and any resident soldiery; for every blacksmith retained the needs of up to one hundred and twenty men or horses can be met, but there must be at least one in every stronghold and a workroom and forge must be provided for each (~400sp). Besides the usual duties (horseshoes, nails, hinges, etc.) a hired smith can turn out some basic weaponry each month: 30 arrowheads or quarrel tips, or 10 spear heads, or 5 morningstars, or 2 flails or polearm heads.

**Engineer (Architect)**: Necessary for the successful construction of any but the most simple of surface structures. An architect requires payment by the month, even for short projects, and expects to receive an additional sum equal to 10% of the total building costs. Unless the construction site was approved by an architect, there is a 75% chance that any structure will collapse in 1d100 months.

**Engineer (Artillerist)**: Mandatory for the construction and correct operation of siege weapons, such as the trebuchet or ballista. No such engines can be made or properly used without the services of such an individual. If employment is for short term only, say a few months or less, then rates of pay and costs will be increased from 10% to 60%.

**Engineer (Miner or Sapper)**: Indispensable for the overseeing of any mining operations, underground construction, or siege and counter siege works that involve trenches, fortifications, assault towers and other similar siege devices.

**Jeweler/Gemcutter**: Able to speedily and accurately appraise the value of most gems, jewelry and other precious objects, a jeweler is also capable of repairing, enhancing or newly creating ornamented items and jewelry. The total value of the materials can be increased by from 10% to 40%, depending on the skill of the jeweler. Likewise, a gemcutter might well increase the value of a rough or poorly cut stone (those under 5,000sp base value), or the stone might be ruined in the process. Note that jeweler/gemcutters cannot be held responsible for damage. Dwarven jeweler/gemcutters add 20% to skill level determination rolls, but cost twice as much to employ.

| Jeweler Skill Level |     |
|-----|-----|
| 01-20 | Fair—10% increase 90% likely |
| 21-50 | Good—20% increase 50% likely, +10% otherwise |
| 51-75 | Superior—30% increase 60% likely, +10% otherwise |
| 76-90 | Excellent—40% increase 70% likely, +10% otherwise |
| 91-00 | Masterful—40% increase 60% likely, +20% otherwise |

| Gemcutter Skill Level |     |
|-----|-----|
| 01-30 | Shaky—d12, one roll, 1 improves, 10-12 ruins stone |
| 31-60 | fair—d12, one roll, 1-2 improves, 12 ruins |
| 61-90 | good—d12, one roll, 1-3 improves, 12 ruins |
| 91-00 | Superb—d20,1-5 improves, 20 ruins stone |

*Note: Giving a gem to a jeweler/gemcutter to improve counts as “spending” it for XP purposes; you gain XP equal to the gem’s original value. Note any increase in value as “profit” in your inventory (e.g., “ring \[200 sp profit\]”) and log it as mercantile income for the month if/when sold.*

**Sage**: A person with a degree of knowledge on just about everything, a lot of knowledge in a few specific fields, and authoritative knowledge in his or her special fields of study. Each sage specializes in one or more minor fields of study, and a handful of special categories within a major field of study. Only fighters, paladins, rangers, and thieves are able to hire a sage, though anyone can consult one; a sage will only accept service on a permanent, lifetime basis. As a sage will bring nothing save thinking ability and knowledge, an offer of employment must consider the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Support & Salary per Month | 200 to 1200sp |
| Research Grants per Month | 200 to 1200sp |
| Initial Material Expenditure | 20,000sp minimum\* |

*\*A 20,000sp expenditure will allow the sage to operate at 50% of normal efficiency, and for each additional 1,000sp thereafter, the sage will add 1% to efficiency until 90% is reached (upon expenditure of 60,000sp). After 90%, to achieve 100% efficiency the cost per 1% is 4,000sp (for the obviously erudite and rare tomes, special supplies and equipment, etc. - assuming such are available, of course). All told, expenditures must be 100,000sp for 100% sage efficiency in specific and exacting question areas.*

**Scribe**: Practiced in the art of writing, a typical scribe is expected to keep records, write letters and copy documents. Others may possess additional skills, such as cartography, counterfeiting, cryptography, illuminating or the ability to write, read or otherwise comprehend more than one language. Such accomplished individuals might command up to ten times the standard wage.

**Ship Crew**: Skilled workers who can handle a ship. Sailors can fight to defend their ship, typically being equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armor.

**Ship’s Captain**: A captain is required for any large ship, is skilled like a sailor, and has an intimate knowledge of the particular coasts they frequent.

**Spy**: Recruited to secretly watch the actions of others and gather information, fees may vary wildly, from perhaps a mere hundred silver pieces to many thousands, depending on the individual and the difficulty of what is asked.

**Steward/Castellan**: Responsible for the administration of a stronghold in the absence or inability of a player character, a steward holds a position of great prestige and trust. Whilst serving within the stronghold, a steward is capable of leading forty men at arms and two lieutenants for every level of experience he possesses, as well as the necessary number of sergeants. The monthly wage due to a steward is equal to his level x 100sp. A retainer of an appropriate class and level could be appointed as steward.

**Weaponsmith**: Required for the production and maintenance of weaponry; for every sixty men at arms present, there must be at least one weaponsmith available. Each must be provided with a workroom, forge, and assistants at an additional cost (~400sp). A weaponsmith can use spare time (prorated based on number of supported troops) to make additional weapons at a rate of five weapons per month at 25% of their usual cost.
