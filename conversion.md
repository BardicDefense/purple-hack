# Converting a Character

Create your character at level 1, and then level up.

Rolls like hit points or a mage's school selection or any caster's spells available are always rolled at the table with the referee & other players present, so simply wait to do those.

## Ability Scores

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution map over directly.

Arcana should be the highest of the old character's Intelligence or Wisdom score. The remaining two scores can be placed in Willpower and Perception as desired.

## Racial bonuses

Do not modify stats (i.e. do not adjust Str/Dex/Con/etc.), but other bonuses do apply.

## Wealth and XP

Currency maps directly, but platinum pieces do not exist; convert them to gold nobles (g.) at a rate of 1 platinum = 10 g.

Experience points are on a different scale entirely. Convert over to the nearest quarter level. For example, if your old character was 2nd level and halfway to 3rd, you'd write "6,000" on your current experience line (out of 8,000 needed for 3rd level).

## Magic Items

Items that provide attack or damage bonuses or AC modifiers need to be adjusted to take into acount Purple Hack's lower bonuses.

For +1 or +2 items, treat the modifier as +1. For +3 and +4 items, treat the modifier as +2. For +5 and higher items, treat the modifier as +3 (+2 if a shield).
