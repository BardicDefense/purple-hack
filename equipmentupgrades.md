# Upgrading Armour and Weapons

## Upgrading Basics

The process of upgrading a piece of equipment always has a number of basic requirements regardless of its type. The following general rules apply:

• Upgrades take the form of tags. Tags add new properties to equipment.
• Each tag is unique and can only be applied to a piece of equipment once.
• Upgrading a piece of equipment with a new tag can only be performed by a dedicated nonplayer craftsperson of the appropriate discipline in a workshop environment.
• Upgrading a piece of equipment with a new tag is a skilled endeavor, taking anywhere from an hour to more than a week depending on the task.
• On your adventures, you may come across equipment already possessing tags; either for sale, offered as rewards, or available through other means.

Due to their extraordinary artisanship and magical reinforcement, magic items can’t be modified using normal artisinal methods. As such, the upgrades presented here can’t be applied to magic items. Furthermore, none of the upgrades presented in this supplement confer “magic item” status to a piece of equipment, though certain upgrades may result in a piece of equipment being considered magical under certain circumstances.

## Upgrading Armour

There are a number of options available to a character to upgrade their armour, from high-cost armour proofing, to useful additions like insulation suitable for cold weather environments. A complete list of these options, as well as cost and any additional requirements, are shown in the Armour Upgrades table below. In addition to the basic rules for upgrading, the following rules apply when upgrading a suit of armour or a shield with a new tag:

• Any prerequisite conditions must be satisfied to apply a new tag, as shown in the Armour Upgrades table.
• Typically, it takes an artisan a full day of work (minimum 8 hours) to upgrade a suit of armour or a shield with a new tag.
• Armour Proofing. The proofing process normally requires a full workweek (5 days) and can only be undertaken by a master artisan. Once added, armour proofing tags can’t be removed from a suit of armour.

### Armour Proofing

The primary method of upgrading armour, proofing is the process of testing and improving a suit of armour’s ability to withstand blows of various types below a certain threshold, being certified as proof against swords, arrows, and warhammers. While all types of armour can be proofed against slashing damage, only medium and heavy armours can be proofed against piercing damage, and only heavy armour can be proofed against bludgeoning attacks.

### Other Upgrades

In addition to proofing, various other upgrades are available to armours meeting the prerequisites for each, as shown in the Armour Upgrades table. Certain upgrades are incompatible, such as the breathable and insulated tags, while others have specific requirements. Certain types of armour upgrade tags may be removable or temporary; when in doubt, consult with your referee.

Upgrading Weapons

Upgrading weapons follows a branching path system, with available options split into multiple tiers. At first, a weapon can only be upgraded with a limited selection of 1st tier tags depending on its type, each of which “unlocks” one or more options from the next tier. The following additional rules apply when upgrading a weapon with a new tag:

• All prerequisite conditions must be satisfied to apply a new tag, as shown in the Weapon Upgrades table.

• 2nd tier upgrades can only be applied by a trained craftsman, with 3rd tier upgrades requiring the skills of a master artisan.

• Typically, it takes an artisan a full day of work (minimum 8 hours) to upgrade a weapon with a new tag.

• Once added, a tag can’t be removed from a weapon.

**Weapon Upgrade Cost Structure**

Upgrading a weapon has a base cost associated with each tier, with subsequent upgrades of that tier costing twice the previous amount for that tier. For example, Erik decides to pay a visit to a local blacksmith in order to have a customized pommel attached to his dagger—adding the balanced tag—for the tier 1 base cost of 100 gp. Later, he returns to have the blade honed—adding the sharpened tag—this time costing 200 gp, with the next 1st tier upgrade costing 400 gp, and so on.

Upgrades are grouped by tier for the purposes of this cost scaling: continuing with the above example, if Erik then wishes to have the blade of his dagger partially serrated in order to improve its effectiveness when slicing and cutting—adding the saw-toothed tag—it would cost 1,000 gp (the 2nd tier base cost) provided that the dagger doesn’t already possess any other 2nd tier tags.
