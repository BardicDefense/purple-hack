## Spell Details

Each spell has a spell rank, range, and duration.

### Range

Range is the maximum distance of the spell’s target, not its area of effect
(though sometimes these are the same). Ranged spells must obey the normal rules
on line of sight and blocked targets, but do not suffer range modifiers. Spells
typically have one of five ranges:

- Self: The spell can only target the caster. However, if the range is “Self”
  followed by an area, the effect emits from the caster and covers the area
  specified.
- Touch: The spell requires the caster to touch the target creature or object to
  affect it, which means that the caster must be within 5 feet of the target at
  the start of the Magic Phase (when the spell resolves). The target can be the
  caster: if so, the “touch” is automatic. A normal attack roll is required if
  the target is hostile.
- Short: The spell reaches up to 40 feet. This range increases by 5 feet for
  every two caster levels.
- Medium: Up to 100 feet, plus 10 feet per two caster levels.
- Long: Up to 400 feet, plus 20 feet per two caster levels.

### Duration

This is the amount of time the spell is in effect. A caster can dispel their own
non-Instant spell effect at will, as a free action.

- Instant: The spell effect comes and goes the moment the spell is cast, though
  the consequences (such as damage) might last beyond this.
- Timed: Unless dispelled by the caster, the spell lasts until its listed time
  has passed. If a spell’s duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly
  by the GM (i.e. the caster doesn’t know how long their spell will last).
- Concentration: The spell requires that the caster concentrate on it to keep
  its effect active. This prevents the casting of another spell and other
  actions, but movement is still allowed. Anything that would disrupt a spell’s
  casting also breaks a caster’s concentration while maintaining one, thus
  ending the spell.
- Permanent: Unless dispelled by the caster, the effect is permanent. The effect
  may still be vulnerable to Dispel Magic or other means of destruction; if so,
  this will be specified in the spell description.

### Area of Effect

For spells with an area of effect, the caster selects a point within range to
centre the effect area, but cannot control what a spell affects within that area
unless the spell states otherwise. If using a grid map, a spell’s centre point
must be at a grid-line intersection, not a square.

The area of effect listed for spells (AoE) may have two values. If so, the first
is radius, while the second is the full area of effect in 5-foot squares, if
using a grid map. The latter can lead to counterintuitive results (e.g. square
fireballs), but is an ease-of-use abstraction to avoid annoyances with
diagonals.

### Reversible Spells (R)

Some spells are reversible: this will be noted in the spell’s title and
description. When one gains a reversible spell both forms are learned, but each
is a different spell for the purposes of preparing spells. For example, Haste
and Slow would occupy separate spell slots (and each could be prepared up to
twice).

### Saving Throws

Spells that allow a save have this noted in their description, with the relevant
Ability modifier to add along with the target needed to succeed. If the spell
does damage, a successful save reduces the damage to that subject by half (round
normally); for all other spells a save nullifies the effect on that subject
unless stated otherwise. If a spell indicates an Ability\*2, this means to add
the target's Ability Score modifier twice to their saving throw roll.

#### Saving Throws & Illusions

Illusions only affect intelligent creatures. A creature is not granted an extra
save to recognize an illusion unless they carefully study it, directly interact
with it (a touch or attack usually counts), make a deliberate effort to
disbelieve it (this requires an action if in combat), or see a result
contravening established reality (e.g. falling through an illusionary “floor”
covering a pit). A save is granted up to once per round in such circumstances,
made in secret by the GM.

A failed save does not dictate one’s chosen actions; it only means that the
creature believes in the illusory reality. This also does not make that reality
in any way real. For example, one might choose to cross an illusory bridge if
they fail their save, and if so would of course fall through it. However, chosen
actions will unconsciously adjust to match perceived reality. For example, if a
victim believes they are in a swamp, they will unknowingly slow their movement
to normal swamp speeds.

Passing a save against an illusion does not dispel it, but reveals it to be
false for that person. Any who know an illusion to be false can use an action to
try and convince others of this; those told can reroll their next failed save
against that illusion.

### Stacking Spell Effects

Regardless of the source, the same spell (or equivalent effect from another
source) cannot be stacked on a single target unless specified otherwise. For
example, two Shield spells on one target does not provide a cumulative effect,
and neither does a Shield spell and a Shield effect from a magical item.

## Spell Descriptions

### Rank 1 Spells

#### Alarm

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 day)_  
AoE: 60-ft radius. Whenever a creature of size level Small and up touches or
enters the warded area, a mental alarm goes off. The caster must be within one
mile of the warded area to receive this alarm; if sleeping, they are
automatically woken. The caster can designate specific individuals, creatures,
or creature types that won’t set off the alarm.

#### Animal Friendship

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
This spell makes a normal animal regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally.
If the animal is currently being threatened by the caster or its allies, it is
allowed a Willpower Saving Throw to resist the spell.

#### Arcane Ward

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
AoE: 50-ft radius / 20 × 20. All chosen subjects apply a +2 AC bonus.

#### Blur

_Illusion (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
The caster’s form appears to constantly shift and waver. Attacks directly
targeting the caster that rely on sight must reroll hits scored on the caster.
If successful, the illusion is dispelled.

#### Chill Touch

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Arcana 14. This spell deals 1D6+2 necrotic damage. If the target is
living, it cannot be healed for the spell’s duration; undead creatures instead
must reroll any hits scored against the caster.

#### Command

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 round)_  
Save: Willpower 17. The caster issues a one-word command to the target, which it
must obey on its next set of actions. The command must be unequivocal, and
something the target can accomplish (e.g. back, halt, flee, fall, approach,
kneel, dance; “die” or “suicide” do not qualify).

#### Comprehend Languages

_Divination (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. Up to five creatures (+5 per caster name
level) can comprehend (but not communicate using) unknown text or speech. Codes
/ ciphers are not broken; nor are references explained. More esoteric
communications, such as pheromones, are not understood.

#### Crystal Resonance

_Evocation (R: Short, D: Special)_  
Either Imprint or Release a crystal worth at least 50d..

Imprint: Hold the crystal or gem aloft for 1 Turn, imprinting a single type of
energy upon it from the surroundings and replacing any previously absorbed
energy. There is a 1-in-20 chance of the crystal shattering and becoming
useless.

Release: Reproduce the stored energy of a previously imprinted gem or crystal in
the environment it now occupies (the area within range). Released energies only
reproduce normal ambient conditions and cannot cause damage, blindness,
deafness, or other special effects.

Types of Energies:

- Light: The lighting qualities of an environment may be absorbed and
  reproduced, causing an area of light, gloom, shadow, and so forth to be
  emitted from the crystal for 1 Turn per Level of the caster.
- Images: A static snapshot of the crystal’s environment can be absorbed for
  later examination. The image is reproduced for 1 Turn.
- Sound: Any sound emitted during the 1 Turn absorption time is recorded and may
  be reproduced.
- Temperature: Warmth or cold may be absorbed into the crystal and re-emitted
  for 1 Turn per Level of the caster.

#### Cure Light Wounds

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
This spell heals the subject of 1d6+2 damage. Add 1d6 damage for each name level
the subject (not the caster) has.

#### Curse

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Arcana. AoE: 50-ft radius / 20 × 20. All chosen targets receive a –2
attack penalty, as well as –1 to Morale checks.

#### Detect Illusion

_Divination (R: Touch, D: 10 minutes)_  
All illusions within view are revealed as such to the subject.

#### Detect Magic

_Divination (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
AoE: 60-ft radius. All magical emanations glow softly. The caster knows the
magic’s strength (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) and the school(s)
associated with that magic. The imprinted energy patterns of memorised arcane
spells glow, surrounding arcane spell-casters’ heads with a halo of rainbow
hues.

#### Detect Portals & Passages

_Divination (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
AoE: 60-ft radius. All hidden doors, compartments, and passages within range
glow softly (unless invisible). Obstructions may obscure the glow.

#### Endure Heat & Cold

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 12 hours)_  
Up to one subject per two caster levels is immune to environmental temperature
effects within most natural bounds (more extreme forms like magma flows, as well
as fire- and cold-based attacks, are not affected).

#### Enlarge (R)

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Arcana 14. This spell causes instant growth of one creature and its
carried/worn items, or one object, in both size and weight. Creatures gain one
size level—two at level 10. Objects increase 10% per level of the caster (max.
100%), to a limit of 5 cubic feet per caster level. If insufficient space is
available to fully grow, the creature/object attains the maximum possible size,
bursting weak enclosures but constrained without harm by stronger materials—the
spell cannot crush something by growth. The reverse, Reduce, either negates
Enlarge or makes a creature or object smaller in the same ratios as Enlarge.
Unwilling victims of either spell are entitled to a saving throw. In all cases,
ability scores, damage, HP, and AC are all unaffected.

#### Faerie Fire

_Illusion (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
LoS not required. One creature or object per caster level can be wreathed in a
pale glowing light visible out to 80 ft; even invisible things can be chosen as
targets (this does not make them visible). Against those targets this applies a
+2 attack bonus, but the fire is concealed by Darkness.

#### Feather Fall

_Transmutation (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Up to five falling (or about-to-fall) creatures within range have their rate of
descent slow to 60 ft per round (occurring in the Movement Phase). A subject
that lands before the spell ends takes no falling damage and can land on its
feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

#### Firelight

_Evocation (R: Self, D: 1 hour plus 10 minutes per level)_  
Conjures a ball of flickering flame around the caster’s hand, floating above
their shoulder, or around object held. The flame sheds light in a 15′ radius,
sufficient for reading, but not as bright as daylight. The conjured flame does
not produce heat and cannot be used to ignite objects or cause damage.

With a magic word, the caster may command the flame to flare suddenly. All
within 30′ who see the flare must make a Saving Throw or be dazzled, suffering a
–2 penalty to Attack Rolls for 1d4 Rounds. The caster is not affected by the
flare, but allies may be unless warned to close their eyes. After flaring, the
flame disappears and the spell ends.

#### Floating Disc

_Evocation (R: Self, D: 4 hours)_  
This spell creates a circular, horizontal disc in an empty space within 5 ft of
its caster. The disc is 3 ft in diameter and 1 inch thick, and floats 3 ft above
the surface beneath it. It can support up to 500 pounds (about 20 item slots).
The disc follows 5 ft behind its caster. It cannot be ridden by the caster, and
cannot cross abrupt elevation changes of over 10 ft.

#### Fog

_Conjuration (R: Long, D: 1 hour)_  
AoE: Up to 50-ft radius / 20 × 20. The caster summons a wall of thick fog that
reduces vision (including infravision) to 5 ft. A wind of at least 20 miles per
hour disperses it.

#### Friends

_Enchantment (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Willpower 14. AoE: 200-ft radius. Intelligent creatures that fail their
save ignore the fact that the caster just cast a spell and instead tend towards
being impressed with the caster, providing +4 to the caster’s party reaction
roll.

#### Grave Shroud

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Undead creatures perceive up to six subjects (+5 per caster name level) as
undead. Mindless undead thus ignore the subjects, unless specifically commanded
to attack them directly, while intelligent undead do not instinctively know them
to be alive, but will likely wonder at their actions or appearance. If a subject
attacks an undead creature, the spell ends for them.

#### Grease

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Dexterity 14. AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. Slick, non-flammable
grease covers the ground. Creatures in the area when the grease appears or who
move into a greased space (even if already in one) must save or fall prone
(limit of one such save per round). For those who make their save, the greased
area is still treated as difficult terrain.

#### Ioun Shard

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: 2 Turns)_  
Conjures a glowing shard of vividly coloured crystal that slowly orbits the
caster’s head at a distance of 1′. At the time of casting or at any point in the
spell’s duration, the caster may choose to fire the shard at a visible target
within range, automatically striking the target for 1d6+1 damage. Once fired,
the shard is destroyed. Higher-Level casters may conjure one additional shard
per 3 Levels: two at Level 4, three at Level 7, four at Level 10, etc. Multiple
shards may be fired simultaneously and may be directed at a single target.
Unlike standard spell targeting, if something can be seen it can be targeted,
even if normal spellcasting line of sight is blocked.

#### Minor Illusion

_Illusion (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates an illusionary sound, scent, or image
(only one). If a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream, and
vary in pitch and tempo as desired. If an image, it is silent and immobile, and
no larger than a 5-ft cube (2 × 2 × 2).

#### Nullify Poison

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
AoE: Up to 10-ft radius / 4 × 4. This spell nullifies all non-magical poison
applied to items (e.g. coated blades and needles; poison in gas capsules, food,
or vials). Creatures naturally using their own poison are unaffected.

#### Pass Without Trace

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. Up to five subjects (+5 per caster name
level) can move through any terrain — mud, snow, dust, etc. — and leave neither
footprint nor scent, making tracking by these means impossible. However, areas
radiate a dweomer for 6d6 turns after an affected creature passes through them.

#### Shield

_Abjuration (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
This spell invisibly wards the caster, providing +5 AC and negating any Magic
Missiles cast at them.

#### Sleep

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 4d4 x 10 minutes)_  
Save: Willpower\*2 14. AoE: 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. The caster rolls 2d6 and
adds their level to the result: that many Hit Dice of living enemies are put
into a comatose slumber. Targets with the fewest HD are affected first, and only
creatures with 4 HD or less are affected. Shaking and slapping a victim as an
action gives them an extra save; mere noise does not.

#### Turn Undead

_Necromancy (R: Self, D: 1D6 × 10 minutes)_  
Save: None. AoE: 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. The caster rolls 2d6 to determine the
result:

- 4 or lower: The undead are unaffected
- 5-6: 2d4 undead are stunned for 1 Round, unable to act.
- 7-12: 2d4 undead flee from the caster for 1 Turn.
- 13 or higher: 2d4 undead are permanently destroyed.

If the caster is a higher level than the targeted undead, add a bonus of +2 per
level, to a maximum of +6. If the caster is a lower level than the targeted
undead, add a penalty of -2 per level, to a maximum of -6.

Attacking a turned undead creature frees it from the effects of the spell at the
end of the current combat round.

In a mixed group of undead with multiple Levels, those of lowest Level are
affected first. On a successful turning roll, the caster may make another roll
the following Round, affecting the next lowest Level type of undead present.
This process may be repeated until all types of undead have been affected or a
turning roll fails.

#### Unseen Servant

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 2 hours)_  
The spell summons an invisible spirit, weightless and Small in size, that serves
tirelessly and fearlessly without question. The servant must remain within 40
feet of its summoner or it is dispelled. It moves as a normal PC, but ignores
terrain. It can carry up to 1 point of encumbrance, and open normal doors, lids,
drawers, etc, but perform no greater feats of strength. The servant cannot fight
or take any other action requiring an attack roll. Nor can it block spaces,
provide cover, or lock opponents in melee. It can be magically dispelled,
banished by anything that banishes spirits, or eliminated after taking 6 points
of magical damage.

#### Ventriloquism

_Illusion (R: Short, D: 20 minutes)_  
The caster’s voice emanates from anywhere within range (e.g. a statue, a
tapestry, an animal).

### Rank 2 Spells

#### Arcane Cypher

_Transmutation (R: 5', D: Permanent)_ Script which the caster passes their hand
over glows and is transformed into arcane sigils incomprehensible to all except
the caster. The text of a single spell in a spell book may be affected, or up to
1 page of normal text per Level of the caster. Magical text cannot be affected.
The Arcane Cypher is only decoded by magic (e.g. by the Decipher spell).

#### Arcane Lock

_Evocation (R: Touch, D: Permanent)_  
This spell bars the opening mechanism of a door, chest, or the like with magical
force. A caster ignores their own lock, but otherwise nullifying the lock
requires force or a successful Dispel Magic spell. The caster can optionally set
a password for other characters to freely ignore the lock. A character 4+ levels
higher than the lock’s caster can bypass or physically force the lock, as can
any Knock spell, but in such cases the lock is not nullified and reengages after
10 minutes.

#### Assist

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject is imbued with a burst of life force, gaining 2d6+2 temporary Hit
Points, plus 2d6 per name level of the caster (not the subject). Unlike healing
effects, additional HP from Assist can take a subject over their limit; if so,
such HP are always lost first. HP above the caster’s maximum cannot be healed.
All Assist HP are lost at the end of the hour; this might conceivably kill a
recipient. A creature can only be the subject of one active Assist at any one
time.

#### Burning Hands

_Evocation (R: Self—30 ft × 10 ft line, D: Instant)_  
Save: Dexterity 14. A burst of flame erupts from the caster’s hands. This deals
2d6 damage, plus 1D6 for every two levels of the caster beyond the second (e.g.
3d6 at level 4, 4d6 at level 6, 5d6 at level 8; maximum 10d6 at level 16) and
sets combustibles alight.

#### Change Self

_Illusion (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Perception 17. The subject’s appearance—including all personal items—is
altered. Height can be altered up to 1 ft shorter or taller, and weight can be
altered to a similar degree along with it. The same basic limb arrangement must
be kept.

#### Charm

_Enchantment (R: Touch, D: 1 day)_  
Save: Willpower 14. Enchants a small object with the power to charm a living
humanoid of Medium size or smaller who willingly accepts it as a gift. A single
recipient who accepts the enchanted object must succeed on the save or regard
the caster as a trusted friend and come to their defence. The caster can give
the subject orders, language permitting. The subject will not knowingly endanger
its life beyond reason. Orders not befitting a friend will grant an extra save.
At 10th level, the caster can affect any one living creature, language
permitting, of up to Large size.

#### Counterspell

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
A caster can always pick this spell (if prepared) as their declared spell in
response to an enemy casting a spell, replacing any other declared spell. In the
Magic Phase, before spells are resolved, the dispeller and the enemy each make a
dispel check: roll 1d6 + caster level + rank of the spell being cast (e.g.,
Counterspell will usually be 2). The highest result wins; ties go to the
dispeller. If the dispeller wins, the enemy spell is disrupted.

#### Detect Traps

_Divination (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
AoE: 60-ft radius. All traps within range glow softly. The spell does not detect
natural hazards, such as a weakness in a floor or an unstable ceiling, and the
glow can be obscured by obstructions (e.g. a trapped door hidden behind a
bookshelf).

#### Enrage

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Willpower 17. The subject flies into a berserker rage. Regardless of its
armament, it always attacks in melee the creature closest to it, friend or foe,
and will fight as offensively as possible, though it will not throw itself over
a cliff or the like in order to reach an opponent.

#### Forget

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Willpower 14. AoE: Up to 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. Chosen subjects within the
area of effect forget the events of the previous minute. For every name level of
the caster, another two minutes of past time is forgotten. A Restoration will
recover the lost memories.

#### Guide

_Divination (R: Self, D: 12 hours)_  
The caster gains a supernatural knowledge of the paths and perils of their
surroundings while travelling overland. The caster applies a +1 bonus that day
to their party’s navigation checks.

#### Gust of Wind

_Conjuration (R: Self—60 ft × 10 ft line, D: 1 minute)_  
Wind blasts from the caster in the direction faced. Unless braced, creatures
that start their round in the line must make a Strength check or be pushed 5 ft
away for each point that they failed the roll by; apply a –2 roll modifier to
flying creatures. Any creature in the line must spend 2 ft of movement for every
1 ft it moves within the line. The gust disperses Fog, Stinking Cloud, and
Cloudkill spells, smoke, vapour etc, and extinguishes small open flames like
torches. Protected flames such as lanterns have a 50% chance to be extinguished.
The caster can change the direction the line travels as an action during their
round.

#### Invisibility

_Illusion (R: Touch, D: Concentration—1 hour per caster level)_  
One creature or object of up to one size level larger than the caster vanishes
from sight. An invisible creature can see itself. Any light source carried is
invisible, but the light it casts is unaffected; dropped personal items become
visible. The spell ends if the subject attacks, though surprise is very likely.
Attacks against invisible targets apply a –4 penalty.

#### Knock

_Transmutation (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The caster knocks on a single closed door, gate, lid, or similar portal with
their hand or a staff. The portal groans, grumbles, and magically opens. Locks
and bars are unlocked or removed. Arcane Locks are disabled for 1 Turn. Shackles
or chains are loosened, but the spell will not raise a portcullis or the like.
Secret doors may be opened, but they must be known to the caster.

#### Mind Crystal

_Divination (R: Short, D: 2 hours)_  
Attunes a gem or crystal (of at least 250gp value) to the subtly radiating
energies of living minds, allowing the caster to detect the presence of
creatures and perceive their thoughts. To pick up thoughts, the caster must hold
the crystal aloft and focus their concentration in a particular direction for 1
Turn without moving. After 1 Turn, the crystal projects the thoughts of all
creatures within range in the chosen direction into the caster’s mind. If
multiple creatures are within range in the direction being focused on, the
caster perceives an incomprehensible mix of all their thoughts. If the caster
focuses for an additional Turn, they can isolate a single creature’s thoughts.
The spell can be maintained for the duration only if the caster continues to
hold the crystal. This spell is blocked by 2′ of rock or a thin layer of lead.

#### Mind Shield

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 12 hours)_  
The subject cannot be detected by mental scans or have their mind or thoughts
read, and their saves against mental attacks are one difficulty level lower.
However, the subject cannot use or receive telepathic signals.

#### Mirror Image

_Illusion (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
In a flash of prismatic light, 1d6 illusory duplicates of the caster appear. The
mirror images look and behave exactly as the caster, remaining within 3′. The
caster’s voice, as well as any subsequent spells cast, emanate randomly from one
of the mirror images or the caster’s true form. Attacks on the caster destroy
one of the mirror images (even if the attack misses).

#### Pacify

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Willpower 14. AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. This spell calms 1d6
living creatures, ending any arguments, combats, or inclinations to them. This
does not create friendly feelings, however. Creatures with the fewest HD are
affected first. A pacified creature that takes damage or is attacked breaks free
of the spell.

#### Perceive the Invisible

_Divination (R: 10' per caster level, D: 1 hour)_  
Invisible creatures and objects in range become visible to the caster, outlined
in glittering gold.

#### Phantasmal Force

_Illusion (R: Medium, D: Concentration)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates the visual or auditory illusion of a
known object, creature, scene, attack, or force of up to Medium size (5'
square). The caster can move the image within the spell’s range. Any “damage”
dealt directly by the illusion is believed to be real (illusory arrows, pit
trap, monster, etc), but vanishes when the illusion is disbelieved or gone and
does no real damage and has no permanent effect. A creature reduced to 0 HP in
this way falls unconscious. Illusory damage and effects last for 1d4 Turns. An
illusory monster can be of a Level no greater than the caster's. The monster may
be directed to attack, having all its normal capabilities and attack forms. It
has AC 10 and vanishes if hit in combat. If the illusion is of something the
caster has not personally seen, viewers gain a +4 bonus to their save.

#### Phantom Steed

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Up to five (+5 per caster name level) ghostly draft or riding horses—caster’s
choice—instantly appear, which serve their riders willingly and well. Each
behaves as a normal horse, except that it will not tire, panic, or otherwise be
frightened, and does not need food or water.

#### Protection from Missiles

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject cannot be damaged by normal missile attacks; these will only break a
caster’s concentration if they hit on a natural 20. Magic or non-personal scale
missiles (such as a boulder from a giant or a catapult) are instead reduced in
damage by 1 point per die of damage.

#### Protection from Poison

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 12 hours)_  
The subject is immune to poison for the spell’s duration (including to any
afflicting them). If cast on one who has failed a lethal poison save within a
turn of their being poisoned, the poison is nullified and the subject lives.

#### Ray of Fatigue

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Constitution 14. The subject becomes heavily fatigued. This has no effect
if the target is already this fatigued or worse, or does not tire (e.g. undead,
constructs).

#### Shocking Strike

_Evocation (R: Self, D: 2 hours)_  
This spell charges the caster’s hand or a weapon they are holding with a number
of charges equal to the caster's level. While charged, attacks made with the
hand or weapon deal an additional 1d6 electrical damage. For a missile weapon,
one charge is dissipated per attack whether or not the attack hits, but a melee
weapon's charges are dissipated only on a hit. The spell adds one damage die per
name level of the caster.

#### Silence

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
AoE: Up to 15-ft radius / 6 × 6. This spell creates a void of silence in which
no sound can be created or pass through. Anything inside the area of effect is
immune to sonic attacks, and creatures inside it are deafened. Casting a spell
that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

#### Spider Climb

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
So long as its hands are free, a subject can climb and travel on vertical
surfaces or even traverse ceilings, with a combat speed of 20 ft per round.
Climbing checks are not required for this, but if one is somehow forced, the
difficulty is one level lower than normal.

#### Stinking Cloud

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Constitution 14. AoE: Up to 15-ft radius / 6 × 6. A mass of nauseous
vapors is created; any within that fail their save is rendered a helpless target
for 1d6 rounds. Passing reduces a victim’s combat speed by half; if in the cloud
at the round’s end the creature must save anew.

#### Transfer

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The caster can transfer their life force to one recipient, living or undead. Hit
Points are transferred to the subject on a 1:1 basis, as determined by the
caster. There is no limit to the amount of Hit Points the caster can transfer,
except that the caster cannot go below 1 HP in this fashion; this is treated as
healing.

#### Unflagging Endurance

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Up to one subject per caster level becomes nearly immune to exhaustion. Subjects
can force-march that day with no ill effect, ignore the first burden level from
encumbrance, and gain a +4 on saves vs. fatigue, sleep, weakness, or
enfeeblement.

#### Water Breathing

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 1 day)_  
Up to one subject per caster level can breathe water freely.

#### Web

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 20 minutes per caster Level)_  
Conjures a volume of sticky webbing, blocking a 10′ cube area. Must be anchored
on at least two opposite sides to solid points. Any creature of size Large or
smaller that moves into the web or is in its area when it is cast is stuck and
cannot move. Characters with Strength below 13 cannot break free. Those with
Strength 13 or above can break free in 1d4 Turns. Large creatures of greater
than human Strength can break free in 1d4 Rounds. The web can be destroyed by
fire in 2 Rounds. Creatures caught within flaming webs suffer 1d6 damage.

### Rank 3 Spells

#### Black Tentacles

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Dexterity 14. AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. Flailing ebony tentacles erupt
from the ground. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature size Large or
smaller that starts its round in or enters the area must save or take 3d6
crushing damage and become immobile. Those restrained save at the start of each
round to free themselves; failure means the damage is dealt again.

#### Blindness

_Illusion (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Arcana 14. One target sees only an impenetrable grey mist (–4 attack
penalty, no ranged casting possible unless LoS is not required by the spell). A
blinded creature can still deliver gaze attacks. Only Dispel Magic, Hex Weaving,
or the caster dismissing the spell ends the effect.

#### Chromatic Orb

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
The spell hurls an orb of energy with a total attack bonus equal to the caster’s
level. When cast, the caster chooses one of acid, cold, electrical, fire, or
poison: on a hit, the target takes 4d6 damage of the chosen type. If the same
number is rolled on two or more of the damage dice, the orb can leap to a new
target of the caster’s choice within 30 feet of the original target (a new
attack is rolled). This can only occur once per orb cast.

#### Cloak of the Void

_Necromancy (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster is wreathed in black flames of negative energy. Any living creature
touching the caster with its body or handheld weapons takes 2d6 necrotic damage,
+1d6 per caster name level. However, undead touching the caster are healed for
the same amount. This effect is not applied if the caster strikes a target, only
if they are struck.

#### Conjure Animals

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
This spell calls local wild animal spirits of the caster’s choice, which
manifest as living examples of those creatures. Hit Dice equal to twice the
caster’s level are summoned, in any combination desired. No single creature can
be above Level 10; none can be intelligent or magical. The creatures serve
without question, but if abused by the caster the spirits will refuse future
calls.

#### Crystal Vision

_Divination (R: Short, D: 2 hours)_  
Attunes a gem or crystal (of at least 500gp value) to pick up the visual
impressions of living creatures, allowing the caster to see through others’
eyes. To establish a connection with a creature, the caster must gaze into the
crystal and focus their concentration in a particular direction for 1 Turn
without moving. After 1 Turn, facets of the crystal reflect silent images of the
current visual perceptions of one creature within range. If multiple creatures
are within range in the direction being focused on, the crystal connects with
the closest. Once a connection is established, the caster may choose to maintain
it or to change to another subject. This spell is blocked by 2′ of rock or a
thin layer of lead.

#### Cure Sickness

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
This spell cures the subject of artificial or magical blindness and deafness
(assuming the subject still has its eyes/ears) and all sicknesses and diseases,
including mummy rot, green slime infection, and lycanthropy.

#### Cure Serious Wounds

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
This spell heals the subject of 2d6+2 damage. Add 2d6 for each name level the
subject has.

#### Darkvision

_Transmutation (R: Touch, D: 1 day)_  
The subject gains the ability to see normally in darkness up to 60′.

#### Disguise

_Illusion (R: Long, D: Concentration—2 hours)_  
Save: Perception 17. The appearance of up to one willing subject per two caster
levels—including all carried items—is altered. Height can be altered up to one
full size category shorter or taller; weight can be altered to a similar degree.
The same basic limb arrangement must be kept. If only one subject is disguised,
the need for concentration is waived.

#### Dispel Magic

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
All spell effects within range are unravelled, disintegrating in coils of
coloured energy. Magic items are unaffected. Curses incurred by a spell are
affected; those incurred by a magic item are not. Effects created by lower Level
casters are automatically dispelled. If the effect is created by a higher-level
spellcaster, each caster involved makes a dispel check: roll 1d6 + caster level,
with the higher result winning (ties go to the dispeller).

#### Fear

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Willpower 17. AoE: 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. Chosen enemies in the area of
effect that fail their save drop anything held and flee from the caster by the
quickest safe route; if cornered, they cower. Targets must be able to feel fear
(even instinctually) to be affected.

#### Fireball

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Dexterity 14. AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. LoS not required. The blast deals
1d6 fire damage per caster level (max 12d6). Combustibles in the AoE are set
alight, and failed saves force item saves.

#### Gaseous Form

_Transmutation (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
A willing subject and its carried items become a floating, misty cloud. The
subject has the same size, flies with a combat speed of 10 (though wind will
propel it at the wind’s speed), and can enter any space not airtight. While
gaseous, the subject cannot talk, manipulate objects, attack, or cast spells,
and can only be harmed by magic. The spell ends if the subject drops to 0 or
fewer Hit Points.

#### Haste (R)

_Transmutation (R: Medium, D: 30 minutes)_  
Save: Arcana 14. Up to one creature per caster level has their Speed doubled and
can take two actions each combat round. The number of spells a subject may cast
per round is not doubled, nor is the use of magic items such as wands. The
reverse, Slow, instead forces targets to act last in the Melee Phase, and their
combat speed is halved. One of these spells can negate its reverse; such a use
has no other effect.

#### Hold Person

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Arcana 17. One living intelligent creature of up to size Medium is
hypnotised and becomes helpless. Damage does not break the affected creature out
of its hold, but the death or unconsciousness of the caster does.

#### Hypnotic Pattern

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Willpower 14. AoE: 20-ft radius / 12 × 12. A twisting pattern of colours
is created. On a failed save, intelligent enemies viewing this can no longer
act: they do not move and become helpless targets. The spell ends for an
affected creature if it takes any damage.

#### Invisibility Sphere

_Illusion (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour per caster level)_  
A selected creature and all creatures within 10′ of it shimmer and disappear
from sight. The spell's effect moves with the chosen creature. Invisibility ends
for anything that leaves the sphere or attacks; this does not affect the others.
Creatures that move into the area after the spell is cast do not become
invisible. Any gear a subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this
includes clothing and armour). Items subsequently put down become visible.
Carried light sources become invisible, but the emitted light does not.

#### Lightning Bolt

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Dexterity 14. AoE: 80 ft long & 5 ft wide or 40 ft long & 10 ft wide;
doubled in water. LoS not required. This bolt deals 1d6 electrical damage per
caster level (max 12D6). Failed saves force item saves (see p. 21).

#### Locate Object

_Divination (R: Self, D: 30 minutes)_  
The caster senses the direction of an object on this plane. There is no range
limit, but distance is only indicated vaguely (close, far, etc). The caster can
search for a general item category well known to them (e.g. “sword”, “jewel”),
in which case the nearest one (if any) is located. Trying to locate a specific
item requires an accurate mental image of that item.

#### Nondetection

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 4 hours)_  
Up to one subject per caster level are invisible to all forms of magical
location, scrying, and divination, including Wizard Eye.

#### Plant Growth

_Transmutation (R: Long, D: 1 day)_  
AoE: Up to 50-ft radius / 20 × 20. This spell causes normal vegetation to
thicken and grow. Within the area of effect, combat speed drops to 5 for
creatures up to Medium size (10 for creatures Large and greater). Line of sight
drops to 10 ft; anything in sight in the growth has heavy cover. The area must
already have at least living brush in it for this spell to function.

#### Protection from Undead

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Up to one subject per caster level gains a +4 bonus to saving throws against
Necromantic spells, and are immune to ability score and level draining by
undead. This does not protect against other drain types.

#### Protection from Unnatural

_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
All chosen creatures within range are warded. Undead, constructs, and
supernatural creatures cannot charm, frighten, or possess the warded creatures,
and must reroll any hits scored against them.

#### Rope Trick

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 2 hours)_  
This spell creates a glowing rope hanging in midair which can be climbed to an
empty extradimensional chamber. When the rope is pulled up behind a climber,
anything inside is hidden from all senses, even magic. The chamber holds up to
32 points in creatures—a Medium creature occupies 4 points, a Small creature 2,
and a Tiny creature 1—along with sufficient air to breathe. Anything inside is
expelled when the spell ends.

#### Serpent Glyph

_Evocation (R: Touch, D: Permanent until triggered)_  
The caster traces a magical, serpent-shaped warding glyph upon a page of text or
a surface, followed by a sprinkling of powdered amber (100gp value). Cast on a
text, the glyph quickly mingles into the script. It can only be detected by
magic. Reading the page triggers the warding magic. Cast on a surface, the glyph
remains visible, glowing pale yellow. Touching the surface triggers the warding
magic. When triggered, a glowing, serpent-like form leaps from the glyph and
makes a single attack against the nearest creature. Its Attack is equal to the
caster’s Level. If the attack hits, the victim is frozen in a glittering amber
bubble of time distortion for 1d4 days (or until dispelled or released by the
caster). While trapped, the victim is in temporal stasis and cannot move,
perceive, think, or act. Likewise, the bubble cannot be moved or penetrated. If
the attack misses, the serpent dissipates with a flash, a bang, and a puff of
smoke.

#### Solvent

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Arcana 14. This spell conjures acid covering up to 1-ft area per caster
level. The acid eats through 6” of wood, leather, or bone, 4” of stone, or 1” of
metal, per round for three rounds. Creatures made of such, take 1d6 acid damage
per caster level in the first round, half that (round up) in the second. Other
creatures only take the damage for one round. Saves are made each round. The
target must make one set of item saving throws, even if they save against the
solvent damage.

#### Spectral Force

_Illusion (R: Medium, D: Concentration)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates the visual illusion of a known object,
creature, or force of up to a 20' cube area, plus 10' per caster’s name level.
The illusion can also have auditory, olfactory and temperature components, and
can be moved within the spell’s range. Any “damage” dealt directly by the
illusion is believed to be real, but vanishes when the illusion is disbelieved
or gone and does no real damage and has no permanent effect. A creature reduced
to 0 HP in this way falls unconscious. Illusory damage and effects last for 1d4
Turns. The illusion has AC 18 and vanishes if hit in combat. If the illusion is
of something the caster has not personally seen, viewers gain a +4 bonus to
their save.

#### Suggestion

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Save: Willpower 14. One intelligent living creature will follow a single spoken
course of action (language permitting, and limited to a sentence or two), if the
caster can phrase it to sound reasonable—even if it isn’t.

#### Tongues

_Divination (R: Touch, D: 4 hours)_  
AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. Up to one subject per caster level can
understand and speak with almost all living beings. This includes animals, but
not plants. Intelligent creatures fall under no compulsion. Most others will
provide information about nearby locations, including what they know of the past
day. Animals may be convinced to perform a small favour.

#### Vampiric Touch

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The first touch the caster makes on a living target deal 1d6 damage for every
two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6. The damage is added to the
caster’s total; any Hit Points over the caster’s normal total treated as
temporary. Such additional HP can take a subject over their limit, are always
lost first, and cannot be healed or otherwise restored; HP above the caster’s
maximum are lost at the end of the hour.

#### Wizard Eye

_Divination (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour)_  
The caster creates an invisible, magical eye through which they can see up to
60' even in complete darkness. The eye can travel up to 240 ft from the caster,
at a rate of 120 ft per turn. Though invisible, the eye is tangible (as big as a
normal human eye). It cannot pass through solid barriers. If a caster moves, it
cannot move the eye that same turn / round.

### Rank 4 Spells

#### Animate Dead

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 1 day)_  
Up to 1 medium humanoid corpses or skeletons of the caster's choosing per Level
of the caster rise as undead under the caster's command. Whatever their
capabilities during life, all created undead use the stats below. They are
unable to use any special traits or powers (including spell casting) possessed
in life. The dead are animated until destroyed, a Dispel Magic spell is cast
upon them, or the duration expires. The caster can make the duration permanent
by consuming 100 sp per Hit Die of the creature(s) animated in ritual components
when the spell is cast.

**Medium Undead**  
Level 1 AC 12 HP 1d8 (4) Att Weapon (+0) Speed 20 Morale 12 XP 10  
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison) and mind-affecting spells.

#### Banishment

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Arcana 14. This spell banishes one creature to another plane of existence.
It remains there until the spell ends, then reappears in the nearest unoccupied
space to its point of banishment. If the subject is native to the plane of
existence the caster is on, the subject is instead sent to a harmless demiplane.
If native to a different plane of existence than the one the caster is on, the
subject is banished to its home plane and must find another way to return.

#### Blight

_Necromancy (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 14. The subject, which must be living, takes 8d6 necrotic damage.
If the caster targets a plant creature or a magical plant, the target’s saving
throw is Arcana 17 instead, and the spell deals double damage. If a non-magical
plant that isn’t a creature is targeted, such as a tree or shrub, it withers and
dies without a save.

#### Clairvoyance

_Divination (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
This spell enables the caster to concentrate upon a familiar locale, no matter
how far away, to see and hear as if the caster were there. Lead blocks this
effect; the caster knows that this has occurred.

#### Confusion

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Willpower 14. AoE: 30-ft radius/12 x 12. This spell causes creatures to
behave unpredictably. It affects 1d6 Levels of enemy creatures per caster level
(up to 15d6). Roll 1d6 to determine the affected group’s actions each round: 1-2
act normally, 3-4 do nothing, 5-6 attack friends. Only creatures of Level 8 or
lower are affected; creatures with the lowest Level are affected first.

#### Destroy Undead

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 14. This spell disintegrates corporeal undead of equal Level or
lower than the caster’s own. Undead of Level 3 or less are automatically
destroyed. Undead of Level 3+1 to 7 can save to avoid destruction, but suffer
3d6 damage even if they succeed. Undead of higher than Level 7 instead suffer
1d6x10 damage (2d6 damage if they succeed). Non-corporeal undead (e.g. banshees,
wraiths, spectres, shadows, ghosts) are not affected.

#### Dimension Door

_Conjuration (R: 10'/360', D: 1 Round)_  
A pair of glowing, door-shaped rifts in the fabric of space open up for a
moment--one within 10′ of the caster and the other at a chosen destination
location; the target location can be known, or the caster can just state a
direction and distance. A single creature may step through the nearby door and
instantly exit the destination door. Transfer in the other direction is
impossible. The caster may forcibly transport an unwilling creature within 10′
by manifesting the nearby door beside them. The target must make a Strength 14
saving throw or be sucked through the dimensional door. The subject arrives on a
safe and stable surface as close as possible to the target; this may be the
starting point; the spell has no effect if the destination is occupied by a
solid object.

#### Divination

_Divination (R: Self, D: Instant)_  
This spell places the caster in contact with a planar power. The caster may ask
one question concerning a specific goal or event to occur within seven days. The
reply might be short or cryptic, but will be truthful. However, the future is as
yet unwritten and so events may render the reply inaccurate.

#### Dominate

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: Permanent until broken)_  
Places a powerful charm on one or more living creatures, either 3d6 creatures of
up to Level 3 or a single creature of higher Level, as chosen by the caster.
Each subject must make an Arcana 14 saving throw or be charmed. The charm lasts
indefinitely, but each subject makes a further save once per day. If one of
these saves succeeds, the charm ends. Subjects regard the caster as a close
friend and come to the caster’s defense. If they share a language, the caster
may give the charmed subjects commands, which they obey. Subjects may resist
commands that contradict their habits or Alignment. Suicidal or clearly harmful
commands are always refused.

#### Duplicate

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 8 hours)_  
This spell creates an exact copy of any single non-magical item the caster
touches. The item to be copied must be able to fit inside a 20-foot cube. The
duplicated item is identical to the original in every way, but Detect Magic
reveals its true nature. At the duration’s end, or if a Dispel Magic is cast on
the item, the item vanishes.

#### Elemental Wall

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: Concentration or permanent)_  
The caster creates a wall of fire, ice, stone, or wind up to 1,000 cubic feet of
volume (e.g. 2' thick, 50' long, and 10' high). The caster must choose the
wall's element at the time of memorizing the spell. If the wall is made of fire,
ice, or wind, creatures of Level 3 or lower cannot pass through the wall;
creatures of Level 4 or higher can pass through the wall, but take 3d6 damage of
the chosen element per 10' traveled. A wall of stone is permanent and must be
supported (e.g. by the ground) and cannot be created in an area occupied by
objects.

#### Enhance

_Transmutation (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
One chosen Ability score doubles for the subject.

#### Fabricate

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
Disassembles raw, inanimate materials within range and weaves them into objects
of the caster’s choosing. Any simple object typically constructed from the raw
materials may be fabricated. For example, a door could be made from trees,
clothing from wool, etc. The object's size may be up to 1 cubic yard per Level
of the caster. Objects fabricated from minerals may be up to 1 cubic foot per
Level of the caster.

#### Free Action

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject is not slowed by difficult terrain or affected by spells (such as
Web or Black Tentacles) or other effects that are physically restrictive in
nature (as opposed to mind-control effects like Hold Person). They cannot be
Slowed. The subject automatically escapes all non-magical restraints, including
grappling. Finally, being in or underwater imposes no movement or Dex penalties
(though this does not allow one to breathe water).

#### Fumble

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Willpower 14. One subject becomes clumsy and awkward. Running creatures
will trip and fall, and those reaching for an item or wielding a weapon will
drop it. While affected, recovery from a fall or of a fumbled object requires a
full round (no movement possible). If the victim makes their save, they are
still affected as per a Slow spell (see Haste).

#### Hallucinatory Terrain

_Illusion (R: 1 mile, D: 1 day)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell makes natural terrain within a 1-mile radius
look, sound, smell, and feel different. The general shape of the terrain cannot
be altered, but minor aberrations can be added (e.g. occasional small
buildings). Creatures in the area cannot be added or removed, but their
secondary elements, such as bird calls, can be. True Seeing does not
automatically pierce this illusion but does grant another save with a +4 bonus.
If an intelligent being touches the illusion, that being can see through the
illusion.

#### Hex Weaving

_Abjuration (R:Touch, D: Instant or permanent)_  
Weaving the threads of fate surrounding the subject, this spell manifests one of
the following effects when cast:

Removing a curse: The subject is permanently cured of the affliction of a single
curse. This spell may be used to enable a character to discard a cursed magic
item. The duration is instant.

Placing a curse: The subject must Save Versus Spell or suffer from a deleterious
effect of the caster’s choosing. Maximum possible effects include: a –2 Saving
Throw penalty, a –4 Attack Roll penalty, halving an Ability Score. The duration
is permanent.

Multiple curses: So long as each has a unique effect, multiple curses may
afflict the same creature.

#### Improved Invisibility

_Illusion (R: Touch, D: 1 turn, +1 per name level)_  
This spell renders the subject invisible, but they are able to attack or cast
their own spells without automatically nullifying the spell. The invisible
creature can attacked with the usual –4 penalty applied to invisible targets,
but in addition its saves are one difficulty level lower.

#### Know Weakness

_Divination (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
The caster discerns a single weakness in one creature, either a physical or
magical vulnerability. The caster gains advantage on attack rolls against this
weakness, and the target suffers disadvantage on saving throws against it.

#### Magic Mirror

_Divination (R: Short, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
The caster creates a mirror-like surface on any solid object. The caster can see
and hear through the mirror as if they were in the location reflected. The
mirror can be moved up to 60 ft away from the caster.

#### Minor Globe of Invulnerability

_Abjuration (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster is immune to all spells of 3rd rank or lower.

#### Mnemonic Enhancer

_Evocation (R: Self, D: Instant)_  
The caster instantly recalls one spell they have previously cast.

#### Overlook

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Willpower 14. One subject becomes oblivious to the caster and their
allies. The subject will ignore the caster and their allies unless attacked, in
which case the spell ends.

#### Polymorph

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 1d6x10 + 10 minutes or permanent)_  
Transforms the caster or another living subject into another type of living
creature of the same size, as chosen by the caster. The spell cannot be used to
duplicate a specific individual. If the subject dies while polymorphed, they
return to their original form. An unwilling subject may make a Dexterity 14
saving throw to resist being transformed.

**Cast on self:** The transformation fails if the new form’s Level is greater
than the caster’s. The transformation does not alter the caster’s Hit Points,
Saving Throw bonus, Attack, or intelligence. Physical capabilities of the new
form (e.g. strength, physical attack forms, modes of movement) are acquired.
Non-physical special traits or powers (e.g. immunities, breath weapons, spell
casting) are not acquired. While polymorphed, the caster is unable to cast
spells. The duration is 1d6 Turns + 1 Turn per Level.

**Cast on another:** The transformation fails if the new form’s Level is greater
than double the caster’s. The transformation does not alter the subject’s Hit
Points, but the subject otherwise truly becomes the new form: all special traits
and powers are acquired, along with behavioural patterns, tendencies, and
intelligence. The duration is permanent.

#### Programmed Illusion

_Illusion (R: Long, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates a visual illusion, plus one other
sensory effect, of any object, creature, or force. The illusion can be
programmed to react to a set of conditions, and can be up to 20 ft in any
dimension. If a trigger condition occurs, the illusion acts in the programmed
manner.

#### Sanctum

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 day)_  
AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. This spell creates a zone of peace and quiet.
No sound can be created within the area of effect, and no creature can attack
another while inside it.

#### Sending

_Evocation (R: Unlimited, D: Instant)_  
The caster sends a mental message to another creature. The caster must be
familiar with the recipient, including their name and appearance. The recipient
must be of at least Animal Intelligence. The message may be up to 25 words. It
is understood by the recipient, irrespective of language.

#### Speak with Dead

_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster can converse with a corpse. The corpse must still have a mouth and
must not have been dead for more than one week. The corpse knows only what it
knew in life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are usually brief,
cryptic, or repetitive.

#### Telekinesis

_Evocation (R: Long, D: Concentration)_  
The caster can move objects with their mind. The maximum weight that can be
moved is 20 pounds per caster level. The caster may move the target up to 20′
per Round in any direction desired (including vertically), but can also hurl the
object, dealing 1d6 damage per 20 pounds and ending the spell. If the caster is
harmed, moves, or takes any other action, the spell ends.

If a creature is targeted, it may make a Strength 14 to resist the spell. If a
held object is targeted, the owner may likewise make a Strength 14 to resist the
spell.

#### Transmute Rock to Mud (R)

_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Arcana 14. AoE: Up to 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. The spell turns stone into
mud. The mud is 2 ft deep, and difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when the
spell is cast must save or fall prone. The reverse, Mud to Rock, turns mud into
stone.

#### Wingbind

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Arcana 14. One flying creature has its wings bound and cannot fly. If the
creature fails its save, it crashes to the ground, taking damage as appropriate.

#### Woodland Veil

_Illusion (R: Medium, D: Permanent)_  
Up to 100 Small or Medium creatures (chosen by the caster) within range are
veiled by illusion, appearing as a copse of trees or an orchard. Once the
illusion is in place, even creatures moving among the veiled subjects are
deceived. Subjects who leave the affected area cease to be veiled. The caster
may dismiss the illusion in its entirety at any time.

### Rank 5 Spells

#### Advanced Illusion

_Illusion (R: Long, D: Concentration—2 hours)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates a visual illusion, plus any other
sensory effect, of any object, creature, or force. The illusion can be up to 40
ft in any dimension. The illusion can be programmed to react to a set of
conditions, and can include speech.

#### Air Sphere

_Conjuration (R: Self, D: 10 minutes per Level)_  
When immersed in water, the caster is surrounded by a 10′ radius sphere of
breathable air. The 10′ radius sphere of the spell’s effect moves with the
caster. Swimming is not enhanced or affected.

_Divination (R: Self, D: 1 round)_  
The caster can sense danger before it occurs. The caster gains advantage on
surprise rolls and saving throws.

appears. Any creature passing through the barrier takes 1d6 damage per level of
the caster, maximum 10d6.

#### Cloudkill

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Constitution 14. AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. A billowing cloud of poisonous
gas appears. It moves 10 ft away from the caster each round. Creatures in the
cloud take 1d6 poison damage per round.

#### Clenched Fist

_Evocation (R: Long, D: 1 round)_  
Save: Arcana 14. The caster creates a giant, spectral fist that strikes at a
target within range. The fist deals 10d6 bludgeoning damage.

#### Contingency

_Evocation (R: Self, D: Special)_  
The caster places a spell upon themselves that will trigger under a certain
condition. The spell must be of 4th rank or lower. The triggering condition must
be clear and specific.

#### Conjure Elemental

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: Permanent until dismissed or slain)_  
Conjures a giant being formed of pure elemental matter (air, earth, fire, or
water) to do the caster’s bidding. The spell requires a large volume of the
appropriate element. If the caster is harmed, moves at greater than half Speed,
or takes any other action, their command over the elemental ends. An elemental
unchained from a caster’s control immediately attempts to murder its creator and
any who get in its way. While control over the elemental is maintained, the
caster may dismiss it at any time, returning it to inert matter.

Save: Willpower 14. All creatures within a 30-ft radius become friendly to the
caster.

#### Mass Suggestion

_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Save: Willpower 14. All intelligent living creatures within a 30-ft radius will
follow a single spoken course of action (language permitting, and limited to a
sentence or two), if the caster can phrase it to sound reasonable—even if it
isn’t.

#### Oracle

_Divination (R: Special, D: Special)_  
Cast while burning 1,000d. of rare dust, the caster attempts to contact a being
on another plane of existence. The caster must make a Arcana check to succeed.
If successful, the caster can ask up to three questions. The questions must
relate to a specific subject—an object, place, or creature. The caster must be
in the presence of the subject or a closely related item (e.g. the tombstone of
a deceased person, the sheath of a lost sword). Questions receive a brief,
cryptic answer. Each answer has a 1-in-6 chance of being false or misleading.
Each casting of this spell takes 1d6 Turns. The spell may be cast at most once
per week. Contact with powerful extra-dimensional beings can shatter the
caster’s mind. The caster must make an Arcana 12 saving throw or enter a coma
for 1d6 weeks.

A 5′ diameter hole is temporarily opened in solid rock or stone, forming a

_Illusion (R: Long, D: 8 hours)_  
Save: Perception 17. The appearance of up to one subject per two caster
levels—including all carried items—is altered. Height can be altered up to one
full size category shorter or taller; weight can be altered to a similar degree.

#### Teleport

_Conjuration (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The caster or a chosen creature vanishes and reappears at a location of the
caster’s choosing with all its gear, up to its maximum load. An unwilling
subject may Save Versus Spell to resist the teleportation. The destination may
be at any distance, but must be known to the caster. The destination must be an
open space at ground level. (The caster may not intentionally teleport a subject
into mid-air or into solid matter.)

When teleporting, there is a risk of accidentally arriving above or below ground
level. The chance of a successful teleportation depends on the caster’s
knowledge of the destination (see below). Roll d100 and consult the below table.

| Knowledge of Dest. | Intended Dest. | Too High | Too Low |
| :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
|       Scant        |     01–50      |  51–75   |  76–00  |
|      Moderate      |     01–80      |  81–90   |  91–00  |
|       Exact        |     01–95      |  96–99   |   00    |

- Scant: A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by
  magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.
- Moderate: A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via
  scrying for several weeks.
- Exact: A location that the caster has studied in-person for several weeks,
  memorising every minute detail.
- Too high: The subject appears 1d10 × 10′ above the intended destination. If
  this is inside solid matter, the subject dies instantly. Otherwise, they fall
  from a height.
- Too low: The subject appears 1d10 × 10′ below the intended destination. If
  this is inside solid matter, the subject dies instantly.

transmutations.

The caster creates an invisible wall of force up to 100 ft long, 20 ft high, and
1 ft thick. The wall is impervious to all forms of attack.

### Rank 6 Spells

#### Control Weather

_Transmutation (R: Self, 3-mi radius, D: Concentration)_  
Weather conditions of the caster’s choosing manifest in the local area (see list
of common conditions below). If the caster is harmed, moves, or takes any other
action, the spell ends. This spell only functions outdoors.

The following are common weather conditions. Others may be possible, at the
Referee’s discretion.

- Calm: Clears bad weather (though side-effects—e.g. mud after rain—remain).
- Extreme heat: Dries up snow or mud (including the Mire spell). Creatures in
  the area move at half Speed.
- Fog: Visibility drops to 20′. Creatures in the area move at half Speed and, at
  the Referee’s option, may also have a chance of getting lost.
- High winds: Creatures in the area move at half Speed. Missile fire and flight
  are impossible. High winds may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships
  by 50%. In sandy areas, high winds cause sandstorms, reducing visibility to
  20′.
- Rain: –2 penalty to Attack Rolls with missile weapons. Mud forms after 3
  Turns, halving Speed.
- Snow: Visibility drops to 20′. Creatures in the area move at half Speed.
  Bodies of water begin to freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and impedes
  movement.

#### Deathshroud

_Necromancy (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Arcana 17. A living creature touched by the caster has a black haze form
around it, draining 20% of its current Hit Points. At the end of every round
thereafter, the same loss is taken. A living creature that touches or strikes
the caster must also save, but at with a +4 bonus. The spell can be ended by
casting Dispel Magic, Restoration, or Cure Critical Wounds on the target, or
killing the caster.

#### Disintegrate

_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 14. The spell targets a single non-magical creature or object. If
the target fails its save, it is reduced to dust. If the target succeeds, it
takes 10d6 damage.

#### Dweomerfire

_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 Round)_  
The caster conjures a magical, prismatic flame that briefly engulfs any magical
energy in a selected 20′ cube within range. Objects, areas, or creatures under
the influence of magic are wreathed in flame. Creatures in contact suffer 1d6
damage. The imprinted energy patterns of memorised arcane spells burn the mind.
Arcane spell-casters must make an Arcana 14 saving throw or suffer 1 damage per
memorised spell. Spells cast by affected creatures this round and next explode
in a conflagration of vivid energy. Creatures casting a spell must succeed on an
Arcana 14 saving throw or suffer 3d6 damage, rendering the cast spell
ineffective.

#### Earthquake Wave

_Evocation (R: Special, D: 1 round per 2 Levels of the caster)_  
A repulsive earthquake 10' wide and 60' long emanates from the caster’s
outstretched hands, pushing other creatures away and knocking them prone. The
caster may turn to affect a new path each Round. All creatures in the path are
pushed directly away from the caster at 30′ per Round and must make a Dexterity
14 saving throw or fall prone. Creatures attempting to move towards the caster
are repelled at their Speed, if it is greater than 30. The caster must
concentrate (no movement or other actions allowed) while repelling creatures.
They may halt to perform other actions and then resume concentration.

#### Energy Drain

_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 14. The caster touches a living creature, draining 1d4 levels.

#### Finger of Death

_Necromancy (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 17. The caster points at one living target; if they fail their
save, they die.

#### Foresight

_Divination (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
The caster gains a limited form of precognition. The caster cannot be surprised
and has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.

#### Geas/Quest

_Enchantment (R: Touch, D: Special)_  
Save: Willpower 17. This spell places a magical command on a creature to
perform--or avoid performing--a certain action. The subject must follow the
command to the best of its ability. If the subject fails to follow the command,
it takes 1d6 damage per day per name level and suffers a level of fatigue.
Dispel Magic is ineffective against a geas. Remove Curse and Hex Weaving only
work if the caster is 2 or more Levels higher than the caster of Geas.

#### Glamer

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Perception 17. This spell alters the appearance of one or more creatures
or objects. The illusion can change size, shape, and color.

#### Globe of Invulnerability

_Abjuration (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster is immune to all spells of 6th rank or lower.

#### Illusory Kingdom

_Illusion (R: Long, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Perception 14. This spell creates a vast illusion of a kingdom or other
large area. The illusion can include buildings, creatures, and terrain.

#### Invisible Stalker

_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: Special)_  
Summons an invisible, extra-dimensional entity to the caster’s presence,
magically binding it to perform a mission of the caster’s choosing. The caster
must be careful with the wording of the mission. Invisible stalkers are
intelligent and treacherous. Unless the assigned mission can be easily and
quickly accomplished, the stalker follows the letter of the command while
twisting the intent. The creature is bound to attempt the mission until it
succeeds or is destroyed.

**Invisible Stalker** Medium Monstrosity—Sentient—Neutral  
Level 8 AC 16 HP 8d8 (36) Att Crush (+7, 4d4) Speed 40 Morale 12 XP 1,040  
Tracking: Without fault.  
Surprise: 5-in-6, unless target can detect invisibility.  
If killed: Returns to dimension of origin.

#### Legend Lore

_Divination (R: Special, D: Special)_  
The caster learns the history and legends surrounding a person, place, or
object.

#### Mass Domination

_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Willpower 17. AoE: 50-ft radius (20 × 20). The spell imposes Domination
(see p. 54) on up to 2 HD / levels of intelligent creatures per caster level.
Commands are transmitted telepathically, and language and distance are no
barrier. The caster can release individuals at will.

#### Meteor Swarm

_Conjuration (R: Long, D: Instant)_  
Save: Arcana 17. AoE: 10-ft radius / 4 × 4 per meteor. Blazing orbs of fire
plummet to the ground at up to four different visible points. Each creature in a
meteor’s takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and 6d6 fire damage. The areas of effect
cannot overlap; if the target area is too small to allow this, meteors are
removed from the spell until no overlap occurs.

#### Move Terrain

_Conjuration (R: Long, D: 1 hour)_  
The land bulges and warps as a terrain feature moves under the caster’s control.
A single feature (e.g. a hill, ridge, grove, pool, etc.) contained in a 120′
square area may be moved. The caster can move terrain at up to 60′ per Turn. Any
buildings or creatures present move with the terrain feature. The caster must
concentrate (no movement or other actions allowed) while moving terrain. They
may halt to perform other actions and then resume concentration.

#### Petrification

_Transmutation (R: Medium, D: Permanent or instant)_  
Manifests one of the following effects when cast:

- Flesh to stone: Permanently transforms a living creature (including equipment)
  into stone. The victim may make a Constitution 14 to resist.
- Stone to flesh: Restores a magically petrified creature (and its equipment) to
  life.

#### Phantasmal Slayer

_Illusion (R: Short, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Perception 17. This spell creates an illusory manifestation of a target’s
worst fears. Mindless creatures are immune, as are those immune to fear. The
slayer attacks as a Level 10 monster; on a hit, if the target fails their save,
they die. On a successful save, the spell ends.

#### Power Word

_Evocation (R: Short, D: Special)_  
This spell has a casting time of 1. When declared, the caster picks one word of
power, which determines the spell’s effect.

- Blind — The word affects up to 75 Hit Points of creatures. If 50 or fewer HP
  are affected, the duration is 1d6 turns; if 51 or more HP are affected, it is
  1d6 rounds. Blindness can be removed by the usual means, and by Dispel Magic.
- Kill — The word destroys a creature with up to 50 HP, or multiple creatures
  with 10 or fewer HP, up to a maximum of 90 HP.
- Stun — One target is stunned: unable to act, dropping anything held, and
  counting as surprised. This lasts a base 10+1d6 rounds, –1 per HD / level of
  the target.

#### Project Image

_Illusion (R: Long, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Perception 20. The caster creates an illusory duplicate that looks,
sounds, and smells like the caster. It reacts naturally to the environment (e.g.
its clothes will move in a draft). The illusion mimics the caster’s actions,
including speech, unless the caster makes it act differently; if the caster
chooses such, then while doing so the spell is a concentration spell. The caster
can replace their own sensory input with that of the illusion’s, thus seeing,
smelling and so on only what the illusion would; if so, the caster’s spells can
originate from the image. The image appears unaffected by spells or missile
weapons, but if the image is touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

#### Scrye

_Divination (R: Special, D: Concentration—2 hours)_  
The spell targets one creature; if willing, the target can permit the spell to
work automatically. Otherwise, to scrye the target is a Hard Task. If the caster
has a possession of the target (e.g. clothes, jewelry), the difficulty is one
level lower; if the caster has a body part, lock of hair, etc of the target, it
is two levels lower. The spell creates an invisible eye about the size of a fist
within 10 ft of the target. The caster can see and hear through the eye as if
they were there. The eye moves with the target; True Seeing reveals it.
Alternatively, the caster can choose a location they have seen before as the
target. If so, the eye appears at that location and doesn’t move.

#### Symbol

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: Special)_  
The caster inscribes one of the following symbols on a surface. Creatures that
pass over, touch, read, or pass through a portal upon which the symbol is
inscribed trigger it, after which it flares brightly, then vanishes.

- Death — Creatures totalling no more than 60 Hit Points are slain.
- Discord — All creatures are affected and immediately fall to loud bickering.
  There is a 50% chance that creatures in different groups attack one other. The
  bickering lasts 3d6+2 rounds; any fighting 1d6+1 rounds.
- Fear — This operates as an extra-strong Fear spell, with a target of
  Willpower 20.
- Hopelessness — All creatures are affected and are overcome with dejection
  unless they make a Very Hard (Arc) save. Those affected will submit to the
  demands of any opponent, i.e. get out, surrender, etc. Roll 2d6 for the
  duration in turns, then 1d6: on a 1-2, those affected take no action, while on
  a 3-4 they turn back or retire from battle, as applicable (5-6 no additional
  effect).
- Insanity — Creatures totalling no more than 90 Hit Points act as if a
  Confusion spell had been placed upon them until a Restoration spell removes
  the madness.
- Pain — All creatures are affected. Wracking pains shoot through their bodies,
  inflicting a –4 attack penalty for 3d6+2 turns.
- Persuasion — All creatures are affected, becoming friendly to the caster for
  3d6+2 turns unless they make an Arcana 17 save.
- Sleep — All creatures under Level 8+1 fall into a catatonic slumber. They
  cannot be awakened for 2d6+4 turns.
- Stunning — Creatures totalling no more than 120 Hit Points are stunned for 2d6
  rounds: they are unable to act, drop anything held, and count as surprised.

#### Unbinding

_Abjuration (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
AoE: 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. All spell effects present are ended, all magic
constructs and animated dead are destroyed (Heroic save to prevent), and all
magically summoned creatures are banished to their place of origin. The spell
does not affect non-animated undead, or creatures that have been gated or
otherwise transported to a plane by means other than direct summoning. If a
spell effect is permanent, and greater than 2nd rank, then it is instead merely
suppressed for 2d6 hours.
