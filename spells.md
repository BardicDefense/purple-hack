**<u>Fool’s Gold</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
Nonmagical metal appears to be gold.

**<u>Guide</u>**  
_Divination (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject gains advantage on Wisdom checks.

**<u>Invisibility</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour)_  
One creature or object of up to one size level larger than the caster vanishes from sight. An invisible creature can see itself. Any light source carried is still visible, and dropped personal items become visible. The spell ends if the subject attacks, though surprise is very likely. Attacks against invisible targets apply a –4 penalty.

**<u>Knock</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
AoE: 10 ft, +50 ft per name level. The spell opens any stuck, barred, or locked box, door, panel or chest in the area of effect, even if hidden. It also loosens shackles or chains, but will not raise a portcullis or the like. It temporarily negates Arcane Lock, but otherwise does not affect magic. A loud knock sounds when the spell is cast: this counts as noisy.

**<u>Mind Shield</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 4 hours)_  
The subject cannot be detected by mental scans or have their mind or thoughts read, and their saves against mental attacks are one difficulty level lower. However, the subject cannot use or receive telepathic signals.

**<u>Mirror Image</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
1d6 illusory duplicates of the caster appear. On a successful direct attack against the caster, roll to see if the caster or an image is struck; any hit on an image causes it to disappear.

**<u>Pacify</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Will). AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. This spell calms 1d6 living creatures, ending any arguments, combats, or inclinations to them. This does not create friendly feelings, however. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. A pacified creature that takes damage or is attacked breaks free of the spell.

**<u>Phantom Steed</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Up to five (+5 per caster name level) ghostly draft or riding horses—caster’s choice—instantly appear, which serve their riders willingly and well. Each behaves as a normal horse, except that it will not tire, panic, or otherwise be frightened, and does not need food or water.

**<u>Phantasmal Force</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Medium, D: Concentration)_  
Save: Hard (Per). This spell creates the visual and/or auditory illusion of a known object, creature, or force of up to Medium size. The caster can move the image within the spell’s range. Any “damage” dealt directly by the illusion is believed to be real (illusory arrows, pit trap, monster, etc), but vanishes when the illusion is disbelieved or gone. A creature reduced to 0 HP in this way passes out for 1d6+2 rounds, then recovers with any phantasmal damage removed. The illusion is dispelled if attacked and struck (it has AC 10); illusionary attacks strike with the same base attack bonus as the caster.

**<u>Protection from Missiles</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject cannot be damaged by normal missile attacks; these will only break a caster’s concentration if they hit on a natural 20. Magic or non-personal scale missiles (such as a boulder from a giant or a catapult) are instead reduced in damage by 1 point per die of damage.

**<u>Protection from Poison</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject is immune to poison for the spell’s duration (including to any afflicting them). If cast on one who has failed a lethal poison save within a turn of their being poisoned, the poison is nullified and the subject lives.

**<u>Ray of Fatigue</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). The subject becomes heavily fatigued. This has no effect if the target is already this fatigued or worse, or does not tire (e.g. undead, constructs).

**<u>Silence</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
AoE: Up to 15-ft radius / 6 × 6. This spell creates a void of silence in which no sound can be created or pass through. Anything inside the area of effect is immune to sonic attacks, and creatures inside it are deafened. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

**<u>Spider Climb</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Short, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
So long as its hands are free, a subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings, with a combat speed of 20 ft per round. Climbing checks are not required for this, but if one is somehow forced, the difficulty is one level lower than normal.

**<u>Stinking Cloud</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Con). AoE: Up to 15-ft radius / 6 × 6. A mass of nauseous vapors is created; any within that fail their save is rendered a helpless target for 1d6 rounds. Passing reduces a victim’s combat speed by half; if in the cloud at the round’s end the creature must save anew.

**<u>Transfer</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
The caster can transfer their life force to one recipient, living or undead. Hit Points are transferred to the subject on a 1:1 basis, as determined by the caster. There is no limit to the amount of Hit Points the caster can transfer, except that the caster cannot go below 1 HP in this fashion; this is treated as healing.

**<u>Unflagging Endurance</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Up to one subject per caster level becomes nearly immune to exhaustion. Subjects can force-march that day with no ill effect, ignore the first burden level from encumbrance, and the difficulty of their saves vs. fatigue, sleep, weakness, or enfeeblement effects is one level lower.

**<u>Water Breathing</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 1 day)_  
Up to two subjects per caster level can breathe water freely.

**<u>Web</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Str). AoE: Up to 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. This spell creates a barrier of sticky strands. To be cast, the Web must be anchored on at least two opposite sides to solid points. Any creature of size Large or smaller that moves into the web or is in its area when it is cast must save or become stuck. Victims can make a save at the end of each round to break free. Those with 18+ Strength can break free or rip through with 1 round of effort. The strands are also flammable, a 5-ft square burning per round.

# 3RD LEVEL SPELLS

**<u>Black Tentacles</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Dex). AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. Flailing ebony tentacles erupt from the ground. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature size Large or less that starts its round in or enters the area must save or take 3d6 crushing damage and become immobile. Those restrained save at the start of each round to free themselves; failure means the damage is dealt again.

**<u>Blindness</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). One target sees only an impenetrable grey mist (–4 attack penalty, no ranged casting possible unless LoS is not required by the spell). A blinded creature can still deliver gaze attacks. Only Dispel Magic, Remove Curse, or the caster dismissing the spell ends the effect.

**<u>Blink</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster rolls 1D6 at the end of each round: on a 4+, they vanish, reappearing in the Ethereal Plane. The caster returns at the start of their next round (and when the spell ends, if on the Ethereal Plane), to a visible unoccupied space of their choice within 10 feet of the space left from (or, if there is no such space, the nearest unoccupied space instead).

**<u>Chromatic Orb</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
The spell hurls an orb of energy with a total attack bonus equal to the caster’s level. When cast, the caster chooses one of acid, cold, electrical, fire, or poison: on a hit, the target takes 4d6 damage of the chosen type. If the same number is rolled on two or more of the damage dice, the orb can leap to a new target of the caster’s choice within 30 feet of the original target (a new attack is rolled). This can only occur once per orb cast.

**<u>Cloak of the Void</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
The caster is wreathed in black flames of negative energy. Any living creature touching the caster with its body or handheld weapons takes 2d6 necrotic damage, +1D6 per caster name level. However, undead touching the caster are healed for the same amount. This effect is not applied if the caster strikes a target, only if they are struck.

**<u>Conjure Animals</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
This spell calls local wild animal spirits of the caster’s choice, which manifest as living examples of those creatures. Hit Dice equal to twice the caster’s level are summoned, in any combination desired. No single creature can be above 10 Hit Dice; none can be intelligent or magical. The creatures serve without question, but if abused by the caster the spirits will refuse future calls.

**<u>Cure Disease</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Short, D: Permanent)_  
This spell cures the subject of artificial blindness and deafness (assuming the subject still has its eyes/ears) and all diseases, including mummy rot, green slime infection, and lycanthropy.

**<u>Cure Serious Wounds</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
This spell heals the subject of 2d6+2 damage. Add 2d6 for each name level the subject has.

**<u>Dig</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
Save: Hard (Dex). The caster can excavate 125 cubic feet of mud or dirt (clay, loam, sand; not stone) per round (i.e. a cube 5 ft per side), the material thrown from the excavation scattering evenly around the pit. Any creature within 5 ft of the pit when it is dug must save to avoid falling in, as does any moving rapidly towards the pit.

**<u>Disguise</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Long, D: Concentration—2 hours)_  
Save: Very Hard (Per). The appearance of up to one subject per two caster levels—including all carried items—is altered. Height can be altered up to one full size category shorter or taller; weight can be altered to a similar degree. The same basic limb arrangement must be kept. If only one subject is disguised, the need for concentration is waived.

**<u>Dispel Magic</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Self or Short, D: Instant)_  
This spell can end ongoing, non-permanent spells cast on a creature, object, or area. Each caster involved makes a dispel check: roll 1d6 + caster level, with the higher result winning (ties go to the dispeller). Magic items cannot be affected.

**<u>ESP</u>**  
_Divination (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
AoE: 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. The caster can detect surface thoughts from one intelligent living creature. The effect is stopped by 2 or more feet of rock, 2 or more inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead (and so will carry through most doors).

**<u>Fear</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Very Hard (Will). AoE: 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. Chosen enemies in the area of effect that fail their save drop anything held and flee from the caster by the quickest safe route; if cornered, they cower. Targets must be able to feel fear (even instinctually) to be affected.

**<u>Fireball</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. LoS not required. The blast deals 1d6 fire damage per caster level (max 12d6). Combustibles in the AoE are set alight, and failed saves force item saves (see p. 21).

**<u>Gaseous Form</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
A willing subject and its carried items become a floating, misty cloud. The subject has the same size, flies with a combat speed of 10 (though wind will propel it at the wind’s speed), and can enter any space not airtight. While gaseous, the subject cannot talk, manipulate objects, attack, or cast spells, and can only be harmed by magic. The spell ends if the subject drops to 0 or fewer Hit Points.

**<u>Haste (R)</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). Up to one creature per caster level gains the effects of the Dash combat stance (even if they don’t use stances), and their combat speed doubles. The reverse, Slow, instead forces targets to act last in the Melee Phase, and their combat speed is halved. One of these spells can negate its reverse; such a use has no other effect.

**<u>Hold Person</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Special (Arc). One or more living intelligent creatures of up to size Medium are hypnotised and become helpless. The caster can choose one target (Very Hard save), or up to four (separate Hard saves).

**<u>Hypnotic Pattern</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Will). AoE: 30-ft radius / 12 × 12. A twisting pattern of colours is created. On a failed save, intelligent enemies viewing this can no longer act: they do not move and become helpless targets. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage.

**<u>Invisibility Sphere</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour)_  
AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. One focus creature is the centre for the sphere: it and any creature in the area of effect when cast become invisible (not to each other). The sphere moves with the focus creature. Invisibility ends for anything that leaves the sphere or attacks; this does not affect the others. Any entering the sphere after the spell is cast do not become invisible.

**<u>Lightning Bolt</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). AoE: 80 ft long & 5 ft wide or 40 ft long & 10 ft wide; doubled in water. LoS not required. This bolt deals 1d6 electrical damage per caster level (max 12D6). Failed saves force item saves (see p. 21).

**<u>Locate Object</u>**  
_Divination (R: Self, D: 30 minutes)_  
The caster senses the direction of an object on this plane. There is no range limit, but distance is only indicated vaguely (close, far, etc). The caster can search for a general item category well known to them (e.g. “sword”, “jewel”), in which case the nearest one (if any) is located. Trying to locate a specific item requires an accurate mental image of that item.

**<u>Negative Plane Protection</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Up to five subjects (+5 per caster name level) are immune to ability score and level draining by undead. This does not protect against other drain types. Saves versus Necromantic spells are one difficult level lower.

**<u>Nondetection</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 4 hours)_  
Up to five subjects (+5 per caster name level) are invisible to all forms of magical location, scrying, and divination, including Wizard Eye.

**<u>Plant Growth</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Long, D: 1 day)_  
AoE: Up to 50-ft radius / 20 × 20. This spell causes normal vegetation to thicken and grow. Within the area of effect, combat speed drops to 5 for creatures up to Medium size (10 for creatures Large and greater). Line of sight drops to 10 ft; anything in sight in the growth has heavy cover. The area must already have at least living brush in it for this spell to function.

**<u>Protection from Aligned</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
All chosen creatures within range are warded. Anointed and supernatural creatures (undead, constructs, extraplanar) of one chosen alignment (Law, Chaos, Good, Evil) cannot charm, frighten, or possess the warded creatures, and must reroll any hits scored against them.

**<u>Rope Trick</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 2 hours)_  
This spell creates a glowing rope hanging in midair which can be climbed to an empty extradimensional chamber. When the rope is pulled up behind a climber, anything inside is hidden from all senses, even magic. The chamber holds up to 32 points in creatures—a Medium creature occupies 4 points, a Small creature 2, and a Tiny creature 1—along with sufficient air to breathe. Anything inside is expelled when the spell ends.

**<u>Solvent</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). This spell conjures acid covering up to 1-ft area per caster level. The acid eats through 6” of wood, leather, or bone, 4” of stone, or 1” of metal, per round for three rounds. Creatures made of such, take 1d6 acid damage per caster level in the first round, half that (round up) in the second. Other creatures only take the damage for one round. Saves are made each round. The target must make one set of item saving throws (see p. 21), even if they save against the solvent damage.

**<u>Spectral Force</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Medium, D: Concentration)_  
Save: Hard (Per). This spell creates the visual illusion of a known object, creature, or force. The maximum size is Medium, plus one size category per caster’s name level. The illusion can also have auditory, olfactory and temperature components, and can be moved within the spell’s range. Any “damage” dealt directly by the illusion is believed to be real, but vanishes when the illusion is disbelieved or gone. A creature reduced to 0 HP in this way passes out for 1D6+2 rounds, then recovers with any phantasmal damage removed. The illusion is dispelled if attacked and struck (AC 18); it fights with the same base attack bonus as the caster.

**<u>Suggestion</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 12 hours)_  
Save: Hard (Will). One intelligent living creature will follow a single spoken course of action (language permitting, and limited to a sentence or two), if the caster can phrase it to sound reasonable—even if it isn’t.

**<u>Tongues</u>**  
_Divination (R: Touch, D: 4 hours)_  
AoE: Up to 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. Up to one subject per caster level can understand and speak with almost all living beings. This includes animals, but not plants. Intelligent creatures fall under no compulsion. Most others will provide information about nearby locations, including what they know of the past day. Animals may be convinced to perform a small favour.

**<u>Vampiric Touch</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The first touch the caster makes on a living target deal 1d6 damage for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6. The damage is added to the caster’s total; any Hit Points over the caster’s normal total treated as temporary. Such additional HP can take a subject over their limit, are always lost first, and cannot be healed or otherwise restored; HP above the caster’s maximum are lost at the end of the hour.

**<u>Wizard Eye</u>**  
_Divination (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour)_  
The caster creates an invisible, magical eye through which they can see, even in darkness. The eye can travel up to 240 ft from the caster, at a rate of 120 ft per turn, and can pass through gaps about the size of a mouse-hole. If a caster moves, it cannot move the eye that same turn / round.

# 4TH LEVEL SPELLS

**<u>Animate Dead</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Short, D: 1 day)_  
This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s simple spoken commands. The maximum Hit Dice that can be animated and controlled at any one time is equal to the caster’s level. The dead are animated until destroyed, a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon them, or the duration expires. The caster can make the duration permanent by consuming 100 sp per Hit Die of the creature(s) animated in ritual components when the spell is cast.

**<u>Banishment</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Hard. This spell banishes one creature to another plane of existence. It remains there until the spell ends, then reappears in the nearest unoccupied space to its point of banishment. If the subject is native to the plane of existence the caster is on, the subject is instead sent to a harmless demiplane. If native to a different plane of existence than the one the caster is on, the subject is banished to its home plane and must find another way to return.

**<u>Blight</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). The subject, which must be living, takes 8d6 necrotic damage. If the caster targets a plant creature or a magical plant, the target’s saving throw is Very Hard instead, and the spell deals double damage. If a non-magical plant that isn’t a creature is targeted, such as a tree or shrub, it withers and dies without a save.

**<u>Clairvoyance</u>**  
_Divination (R: Self, D: 10 minutes)_  
This spell enables the caster to concentrate upon a familiar locale, no matter how far away, to see and hear as if the caster were there. Lead blocks this effect; the caster knows that this has occurred.

**<u>Confusion</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Will). This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably. It affects 1d6 HD worth of enemy creatures per caster level (up to 15d6). Roll 1d6 to determine the affected group’s actions each round: 1-2 act normally, 3-4 do nothing, 5-6 attack friends. Only creatures with 8 HD or less are affected; creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.

**<u>Destroy Undead</u>**  
_Necromancy (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
Save: Hard. This spell disintegrates corporeal undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the caster’s own. Undead of 3 HD or less are automatically destroyed. Undead of 3+1 to 7 HD can save to avoid destruction, but suffer 3d6 damage even if they succeed. Undead of more than 7 HD instead suffer 1d6x10 damage (2d6 damage if they succeed). Non-corporeal undead (e.g. banshees, wraiths, spectres, shadows, ghosts) are not affected.

**<u>Dimension Door</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Touch, D: Instant)_  
This spell transfers the subject to another spot up to 180 ft distant. The target location can be known, or the caster can just state a direction and distance. The subject arrives on a safe and stable surface as close as possible to the target; this may be the starting point.

**<u>Divination</u>**  
_Divination (R: Self, D: Instant)_  
This spell places the caster in contact with a planar power. The caster may ask one question concerning a specific goal or event to occur within seven days. The reply might be short or cryptic, but will be truthful. However, the future is as yet unwritten and so events may render the reply inaccurate.

**<u>Domination</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Will). The spell affects one intelligent subject, who becomes powerless to resist the caster. Commands can be given verbally or mentally, as a free action, as long as the subject is within range. The subject can be forced to use their powers and abilities, assuming the caster knows of them (a victim’s secrets are not automatically revealed). If the victim is ordered to do something they would find abhorrent, they are first granted another saving throw.

**<u>Duplicate</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Medium, D: 8 hours)_  
This spell creates an exact copy of any single non-magical item the caster touches. The item to be copied must be able to fit inside a 20-foot cube. The duplicated item is identical to the original in every way, but Detect Magic reveals its true nature. At the duration’s end, or if a Dispel Magic is cast on the item, the item vanishes.

**<u>Free Action</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 hour)_  
The subject is not slowed by difficult terrain or affected by spells (such as Web or Black Tentacles) or other effects that are physically restrictive in nature (as opposed to mind-control effects like Hold Person). They cannot be Slowed. The subject automatically escapes all non-magical restraints, including grappling. Finally, being in or underwater imposes no movement or Dex penalties (though this does not allow one to breathe water).

**<u>Fumble</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Will). One subject becomes clumsy and awkward. Running creatures will trip and fall, and those reaching for an item or wielding a weapon will drop it. While affected, recovery from a fall or of a fumbled object requires a full round (no movement possible). If the victim makes their save, they are still affected as per a Slow spell (see Haste).

**<u>Hallucinatory Terrain</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Long, D: 1 day)_  
Save: Hard (Per). This spell makes natural terrain within a 1-mile radius look, sound, smell, and feel different. The general shape of the terrain cannot be altered, but minor aberrations can be added (e.g. occasional small buildings). Creatures in the area cannot be added or removed, but their secondary elements, such as bird calls, can be. True Seeing does not automatically pierce this illusion but does grant another save, which is one difficulty level lower.

**<u>Ice Storm</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Long, D: 1 round)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). AoE: 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. Hailstones and ice shards strike the ground, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 cold damage. The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of the caster’s next turn.

**<u>Improved Invisibility</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: Concentration—1 hour)_  
One creature or object of up to one size level larger than the caster vanishes from sight. An invisible creature can see itself. Any light source carried is still visible, and dropped personal items become visible. The spell ends if the subject attacks, though surprise is very likely. Attacks against invisible targets apply a –4 penalty.

**<u>Know Weakness</u>**  
_Divination (R: Short, D: Instant)_  
The caster discerns a single weakness in one creature, either a physical or magical vulnerability. The caster gains advantage on attack rolls against this weakness, and the target suffers disadvantage on saving throws against it.

**<u>Magic Mirror</u>**  
_Divination (R: Short, D: Concentration—10 minutes)_  
The caster creates a mirror-like surface on any solid object. The caster can see and hear through the mirror as if they were in the location reflected. The mirror can be moved up to 60 ft away from the caster.

**<u>Overlook</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Short, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Will). One subject becomes oblivious to the caster and their allies. The subject will ignore the caster and their allies unless attacked, in which case the spell ends.

**<u>Phantasmal Killer</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Very Hard (Per). This spell creates an illusory manifestation of a target’s worst fears. Creatures of Non- intelligence are immune, as are those immune to fear. The slayer attacks as a 10-HD monster; on a hit, if the target fails their save, they die. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**<u>Polymorph Self</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
The caster can assume the form of any creature of the same size. The caster’s original mind and Hit Points are kept; mental abilities, magic powers, and level-draining are never gained. Otherwise, all abilities, scores, and weaknesses of the new form are possessed.

**<u>Programmed Illusion</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Long, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Hard (Per). This spell creates a visual illusion, plus one other sensory effect, of any object, creature, or force. The illusion can be programmed to react to a set of conditions, and can be up to 20 ft in any dimension. If a trigger condition occurs, the illusion acts in the programmed manner.

**<u>Remove Curse</u>**

_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: 1 day)_

**<u>Thunderclap</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Self, D: Instant)_  
AoE: 10-ft radius / 4 × 4. A thunderous boom issues forth from the caster. All creatures within the area of effect must make a Hard (Con) save or be deafened for 1D6 rounds.

**<u>Transmute Rock to Mud (R)</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Short, D: 10 minutes)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). AoE: Up to 20-ft radius / 8 × 8. The spell turns stone into mud. The mud is 2 ft deep, and difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast must save or fall prone. The reverse, Mud to Rock, turns mud into stone.

**<u>Wingbind</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Medium, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Hard (Arc). One flying creature has its wings bound and cannot fly. If the creature fails its save, it crashes to the ground, taking damage as appropriate.

**<u>Legend Lore</u>**  
_Divination (R: Special, D: Special)_  
The caster learns the history and legends surrounding a person, place, or object.

**<u>Mass Domination</u>**  
_Enchantment (R: Medium, D: Permanent)_  
Save: Very Hard (Will). AoE: 50-ft radius (20 × 20). The spell imposes Domination (see p. 54) on up to 2 HD / levels of intelligent creatures per caster level. Commands are transmitted telepathically, and language and distance are no barrier. The caster can release individuals at will.

**<u>Meteor Swarm</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Long, D: Instant)_  
Save: Very Hard (Arc). AoE: 10-ft radius / 4 × 4 per meteor. Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at up to four different visible points. Each creature in a meteor’s takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and 6d6 fire damage. The areas of effect cannot overlap; if the target area is too small to allow this, meteors are removed from the spell until no overlap occurs.

**<u>Phantasmal Slayer</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Short, D: 1 minute)_  
Save: Very Hard (Per). This spell creates an illusory manifestation of a target’s worst fears. Creatures of Non- intelligence are immune, as are those immune to fear. The slayer attacks as a 10-HD monster; on a hit, if the target fails their save, they die. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**<u>Power Word</u>**  
_Evocation (R: Short, D: Special)_  
This spell has a casting time of 1. When declared, the caster picks one word of power, which determines the spell’s effect.

- Blind — The word affects up to 75 Hit Points of creatures. If 50 or fewer HP are affected, the duration is 1d6 turns; if 51 or more HP are affected, it is 1d6 rounds. Blindness can be removed by the usual means, and by Dispel Magic.
- Kill — The word destroys a creature with up to 50 HP, or multiple creatures with 10 or fewer HP, up to a maximum of 90 HP.
- Stun — One target is stunned: unable to act, dropping anything held, and counting as surprised. This lasts a base 10+1d6 rounds, –1 per HD / level of the target.

**<u>Project Image</u>**  
_Illusion (R: Long, D: 1 hour)_  
Save: Heroic (Per). The caster creates an illusory duplicate that looks, sounds, and smells like the caster. It reacts naturally to the environment (e.g. its clothes will move in a draft). The illusion mimics the caster’s actions, including speech, unless the caster makes it act differently; if the caster chooses such, then while doing so the spell is a concentration spell. The caster can replace their own sensory input with that of the illusion’s, thus seeing, smelling and so on only what the illusion would; if so, the caster’s spells can originate from the image.

**<u>Scrye</u>**  
_Divination (R: Special, D: Concentration—2 hours)_  
The spell targets one creature; if willing, the target can permit the spell to work automatically. Otherwise, to scrye the target is a Hard Task. If the caster has a possession of the target (e.g. clothes, jewelry), the difficulty is one level lower; if the caster has a body part, lock of hair, etc of the target, it is two levels lower. The spell creates an invisible eye about the size of a fist within 10 ft of the target. The caster can see and hear through the eye as if they were there. The eye moves with the target; True Seeing reveals it. Alternatively, the caster can choose a location they have seen before as the target. If so, the eye appears at that location and doesn’t move.

**<u>Shape Change</u>**  
_Transmutation (R: Self, D: 1 hour)_  
The caster can assume the form of any creature the caster has seen, short of a demigod or daemon prince. The caster’s original mind and Hit Points are kept; mental abilities, magic powers, and level-draining are never gained. Otherwise, all abilities, scores, and weaknesses of the new form are possessed. The form can be changed once per round: this requires the entire round. Damage and negative status effects (such as Slow, blindness, etc) are not healed by a change.

**<u>Symbol</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Touch, D: Special)_  
The caster inscribes one of the following symbols on a surface. Creatures that pass over, touch, read, or pass through a portal upon which the symbol is inscribed trigger it, after which it flares brightly, then vanishes.

- Death — Creatures totalling no more than 60 Hit Points are slain.
- Discord — All creatures are affected and immediately fall to loud bickering. There is a 50% chance that creatures of different alignments attack one other. The bickering lasts 3d6+2 rounds; any fighting 1d6+1 rounds.
- Fear — This operates as an extra-strong Fear spell, the difficulty of the save being one level higher (Heroic).
- Hopelessness — All creatures are affected and are overcome with dejection unless they make a Very Hard (Arc) save. Those affected will submit to the demands of any opponent, i.e. get out, surrender, etc. Roll 2d6 for the duration in turns, then 1d6: on a 1-2, those affected take no action, while on a 3-4 they turn back or retire from battle, as applicable (5-6 no additional effect).
- Insanity — Creatures totalling no more than 90 Hit Points act as if a Confusion spell had been placed upon them until a Restoration spell removes the madness.
  -Pain — All creatures are affected. Wracking pains shoot through their bodies, inflicting a –4 attack penalty for 3d6+2 turns.
- Persuasion — All creatures are affected, becoming of the same alignment as and friendly to the caster for 3d6+2 turns unless they make a Very Hard (Arc) save.
- Sleep — All creatures under 8+1 HD fall into a catatonic slumber. They cannot be awakened for 2d6+4 turns.
- Stunning — Creatures totalling no more than 120 Hit Points are stunned for 2d6 rounds: they are unable to act, drop anything held, and count as surprised.

**<u>Unbinding</u>**  
_Abjuration (R: Medium, D: Instant)_  
AoE: 40-ft radius / 16 × 16. All spell effects present are ended, all magic constructs and animated dead are destroyed (Heroic save to prevent), and all magically summoned creatures are banished to their place of origin. The spell does not affect non-animated undead, or creatures that have been gated or otherwise transported to a plane by means other than direct summoning. If a spell effect is permanent, and greater than 2nd level, then it is instead merely suppressed for 2d6 hours.

**<u>Wish</u>**  
_Conjuration (R: Special, D: Special)_  
The spell will fulfill literally the utterance of the caster, or duplicate the function of any lower-level Evocation spell. Greedy desires will usually end in disaster for the wisher.
