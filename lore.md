## Timeline of History

_The history of this world is essentially the history of our own, with a few
changes:_

**Beginning of Days**: The world is untrod by humanoid sentient life; spirits of
the woods and forest manifested in the form of primeval or elemental beings
later revered as gods or saints and some as the first dragons.

**The fey venture into mortal realms**: Beings from the timeless realm of faerie
find their way into the young world. Some tarried for a short while; others
established dwellings and kingdoms, like the Cold Prince in Dolmenwood.

**Recorded history**: Begins approximately 3500 BC.

**-2400s**: Town of Seloy in southeastern Vinland founded.

**-2000s**: First human villages established in Piooc, Vinland.

**-1400s**: Arrival of mortals in Tribania; breggles (goat-folk) in Dolmenwood
serve the Cold Prince, and humans living in the isle begin trade with the faerie
kingdom.

**-900s**: Considered the beginning of official known history in Tribania,
commencing with the gradual withdrawal of the Cold Prince into his Faerie realm,
Frigia. The cycle of seasons returns to the area; only Dwelmfurgh, where the
prince's castle was located on the verge of Lake Longmere, remains frozen.

**-800s**: Humans, an occult cabal known as the Drune, first venture into the
forest of Dolmenwood. They establish Drune Lodge in the depths of Dwelmfurgh and
discover the existence of ley lines and the Wood Gods in the forest.

**-700s**: Other humans--unaffiliated with the Drune--settle in and around
Dolmenwood and venerate the Wood Gods, establishing the Gwyrae religion and the
traditions and practices of witchcraft in Dolmenwood.

**-753**: City of Archontos founded.

**-650-600**: The Drune bind Gheillough, the dragon spirit of the lake, greatly
increasing their control of the magic in Dolmenwood. As the Drune's power rises
and the Cold Prince's wanes, the breggles who had served the fae aristocracy
swear fealty to the Drune instead.

**-635**: City of Anfa founded.

**-570**: Town of Chebucto founded by the Mi'kmaq.

**-509**: Beginning of the Archontean Republic.

**-414**: Hraigl the breggle steals the Horned Crown of the Hydrogyle and leads
the breggle in a rebellion against the Drune. The Crown is destroyed. The
longhorn nobility, for the most part, trace their ancestry back to Hraigl.

**-275**: City of Portus Cale, now known as Porto (or colloquially as
Waterdeep), founded at the mouth of the Douro River in the Iberian Peninsula.

**-114**: Thorcin settlers arrive in Tribania, rapidly inhabiting the
south-eastern reaches of Dolmenwood and appropriating the small number of extant
settlements as their own.

**-78**: The Archontean heroes and adventurers, Arden and Vul, discover the
place of power that later bears their name, namely the cliff and cavern systems
of Arden Vul.

**-76**: The Archontean Republic begins to send scouting parties to Tribania to
assess its suitability for conquest and appropriation. They discover Dolmenwood
and attract the attention of the Cold Prince.

**-55**: Led by the Cold Prince in Dolmenwood, other fey throughout the
Archontean Republic’s mortal holdings turn their minds once more to the mortal
realms, which they still regard as their own property. Asserting his claim to
the mortal realms, the Cold Prince causes a fey winter to fall on Dolmenwood.
The dispute soon spreads throughout the Republic, and escalates to full-scale
war.

**-54**: Attempting to end the war at its source, Julius Caesar attempts two
invasions of Tribania and fights the Cold Prince upon the battlefield of the
High Wold. Eventually, the Archontean general retreats from the island.

**-27**: Beginning of the Archontean Empire.

**-14**: City of Arden Vul founded by imperial decree, and the emperor Augustus
appoints Fretevus of Haldur as the first archon of the city.

**0**: Following decades of all-out war throughout the empire, the Emperor
Augustus makes a desperate and unlikely alliance with the power-hungry Drune in
Dolmenwood and dragon-kind throughout the realm. This alliance--known as the
"Triple Compact" and which gave Tribania its modern name--banishes the Cold
Prince from Dolmenwood and the faerie courts from the mortal realms, at last
freeing the central woods of Dolmenwood from their ages-old mantle of frost. The
Wyrdwood rises.

**4-8**: Marius Tricotor, archon of Arden Vul, defeats or subjugates all other
denizens of the Halls below the city.

**43**: Aulus Plautius leads an army of forty thousand to invade the rest of
Tribania; Emperor Claudius makes Tribania a part of the Archontean Empire.

**49**: City of Sterling founded.

**96-180**: The Archontean Golden Age

**110**: City of Tiwanaku founded; beginning of the Hesperian Tiwanaku Polity
that would last 900 years.

**176**: Priscus Pulcher emerges as a leading voice seeking to democratize the
teaching of magic throughout the Archontean Empire; he becomes one of the most
important leaders of the emerging Sortian party.

**187**: The Order of Thoth announces the formation of the first new collegium,
the New Imperial Academy.

**192-197**: War of radical egalitarian Sortians & conservative Theosophs
weakens central authority of Archontos. Septimus Severus emerges as emperor.

**195**: City of Arden Vul brutally sacked by dragons and renegade Sortians
during the war of Sortians and Theosophs. The archon, Uriel Basileon, dies in
her palace. The Archonteans are expelled from the Lower Halls.

Pluritine Church.

**367-369**: A new Caledonian Confederacy of Thorcin & Wiskin forces, lead by

**610**: Altawhid al-Sayf founds a monotheistic and militaristic religion that

Africa.

**686**: A wandering chaos godling--known to the learned as Atanuwë
Nine-legs--arrives in Dolmenwood and establishes a secret court around

**805**: In an attempt to bolster his own claims to the Eastern throne, Emperor
Nikephoros the Logothete dispatches an expedition led by Adrienic to reoccupy

**993**: Explorer Rashid ibn Ahmad takes part in an expedition across the
Atlantic ocean & lands at Marajoáca, thus establishing contact between Hesperia

**1050**: The Almoravid Caliphate begins its conquests.

**1052**: Jean-Giscard Malévol abandons Castle Xyntillan.

**1054**: A schism shatters the unity of the Pluritine Church; the central
question is over the obvious power granted by saints, gods-turned-saints,
godlings, and elemental powers to their devotees. The Western half of the Empire
is mostly monolatrous, maintaining that the saints of the One True God deserve
devotion, but that the old gods and godlings are real though false and should
absolutely never be revered. The Eastern half is mostly henotheistic,
acknowledging the One True God, but insisting that the saints and
former-gods-now-saints of the Archontean Empire are true (though significantly
lesser) deities in their own right. A small portion of the faith in Archontos
itself maintains a monotheistic view: worship is due only to the One True God,
while saints (a broad term that includes godlings and former pagan gods) are
worthy only of reverent devotion; devotion to these saints ultimately redounds
wittingly or unwittingly to the benefit of the One True God, from whom comes all
clerical power.

**1061**: Lady Alexia Basileon leads a sept of the Knights of the Azure Shield
to a tiny Thorcin community named Gosterwick, near the falls of Arden Vul. The
knights restore an ancient fortress and Lady Alexia renames the community
Vetucaster; she proceeds to expand the community rapidly, offering residence,
citizenship, and services to adventurers and others.

**1062**: City of Marrakesh founded.

**1066**: Norman conquest of Tribania. William becomes King William I of
Tribania. He pushes out the remaining Archontean foothold in Burdock's Valley,
but retains Archontean leaders and language there after extracting an oath of
fealty.

**1070s**: Harrying of the North in Tribania, where William I suppresses
northern Thorcin resistance with severe devastation and depopulation. The
Thorcin Recovery League is founded during this time.

**Current Year**: 1086
