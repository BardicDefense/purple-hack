## Timeline of History

_The history of this world is essentially the history of our own, with a few
changes:_

**Beginning of Days**: The world is untrod by humanoid sentient life; spirits of
the woods and forest manifested in the form of primeval or elemental beings
later revered as gods or saints and some as the first dragons.

**The fey venture into mortal realms**: Beings from the timeless realm of faerie
find their way into the young world. Some tarried for a short while; others
established dwellings and kingdoms, like the Cold Prince in Dolmenwood.

**Recorded history**: Begins approximately 3500 BC.

**-2400s**: Town of Seloy in southeastern Vinland founded.

**-2000s**: First human villages established in Piooc, Vinland.

**-1400s**: Arrival of mortals in Tribania; breggles (goat-folk) in Dolmenwood
serve the Cold Prince, and humans living in the isle begin trade with the faerie
kingdom.

**-900s**: Considered the beginning of official known history in Tribania,
commencing with the gradual withdrawal of the Cold Prince into his Faerie realm,
Frigia. The cycle of seasons returns to the area; only Dwelmfurgh, where the
prince's castle was located on the verge of Lake Longmere, remains frozen.

**-800s**: Humans, an occult cabal known as the Drune, first venture into the
forest of Dolmenwood. They establish Drune Lodge in the depths of Dwelmfurgh and
discover the existence of ley lines and the Wood Gods in the forest.

**-700s**: Other humans--unaffiliated with the Drune--settle in and around
Dolmenwood and venerate the Wood Gods, establishing the Gwyrae religion and the
traditions and practices of witchcraft in Dolmenwood.

**-753**: City of Archontos founded.

**-650-600**: The Drune bind Gheillough, the dragon spirit of the lake, greatly
increasing their control of the magic in Dolmenwood. As the Drune's power rises
and the Cold Prince's wanes, the breggles who had served the fae aristocracy
swear fealty to the Drune instead.

**-635**: City of Anfa founded.

**-570**: Town of Chebucto founded by the Mi'kmaq.

**-509**: Beginning of the Archontean Republic.

**-414**: Hraigl the breggle steals the Horned Crown of the Hydrogyle and leads
the breggle in a rebellion against the Drune. The Crown is destroyed. The
longhorn nobility, for the most part, trace their ancestry back to Hraigl.

**-275**: City of Portus Cale, now known as Porto (or colloquially as
Waterdeep), founded at the mouth of the Douro River in the Iberian Peninsula.

**-114**: Thorcin settlers arrive in Tribania, rapidly inhabiting the
south-eastern reaches of Dolmenwood and appropriating the small number of extant
settlements as their own.

**-78**: The Archontean heroes and adventurers, Arden and Vul, discover the
place of power that later bears their name, namely the cliff and cavern systems
of Arden Vul.

**-76**: The Archontean Republic begins to send scouting parties to Tribania to
assess its suitability for conquest and appropriation. They discover Dolmenwood
and attract the attention of the Cold Prince.

**-55**: Led by the Cold Prince in Dolmenwood, other fey throughout the
Archontean Republic’s mortal holdings turn their minds once more to the mortal
realms, which they still regard as their own property. Asserting his claim to
the mortal realms, the Cold Prince causes a fey winter to fall on Dolmenwood.
The dispute soon spreads throughout the Republic, and escalates to full-scale
war.

**-54**: Attempting to end the war at its source, Julius Caesar attempts two
invasions of Tribania and fights the Cold Prince upon the battlefield of the
High Wold. Eventually, the Archontean general retreats from the island.

**-27**: Beginning of the Archontean Empire.

**-14**: City of Arden Vul founded by imperial decree, and the emperor Augustus
appoints Fretevus of Haldur as the first archon of the city.

**0**: Following decades of all-out war throughout the empire, the Emperor
Augustus makes a desperate and unlikely alliance with the power-hungry Drune in
Dolmenwood and dragon-kind throughout the realm. This alliance--known as the
"Triple Compact" and which gave Tribania its modern name--banishes the Cold
Prince from Dolmenwood and the faerie courts from the mortal realms, at last
freeing the central woods of Dolmenwood from their ages-old mantle of frost. The
Wyrdwood rises.

**4-8**: Marius Tricotor, archon of Arden Vul, defeats or subjugates all other
denizens of the Halls below the city.

**43**: Aulus Plautius leads an army of forty thousand to invade the rest of
Tribania; Emperor Claudius makes Tribania a part of the Archontean Empire.

**44**: City of Camoldun founded.

**49**: City of Sterling founded.

**96-180**: The Archontean Golden Age

**110**: City of Tiwanaku founded; beginning of the Hesperian Tiwanaku Polity
that would last 900 years.

**176**: Priscus Pulcher emerges as a leading voice seeking to democratize the
teaching of magic throughout the Archontean Empire; he becomes one of the most
important leaders of the emerging Sortian party.

**187**: The Order of Thoth announces the formation of the first new collegium,
the New Imperial Academy.

**192-197**: War of radical egalitarian Sortians & conservative Theosophs
weakens central authority of Archontos. Septimus Severus emerges as emperor.

**195**: City of Arden Vul brutally sacked by dragons and renegade Sortians
during the war of Sortians and Theosophs. The archon, Uriel Basileon, dies in
her palace. The Archonteans are expelled from the Lower Halls.

Pluritine Church.

**367-369**: A new Caledonian Confederacy of Thorcin & Wiskin forces, lead by
Sir Lazlo, rebel against Archontean rule in Tribania in an event later known as

**600**: The Illini elves found the city of Cahokia in central Vinland.

**610**: Altawhid al-Sayf founds a monotheistic and militaristic religion that

True God. The Sayfian religion rapidly spreads throughout the Middle East and
Africa.

**686**: A wandering chaos godling--known to the learned as Atanuwë
Nine-legs--arrives in Dolmenwood and establishes a secret court around
Sargstone. Over the next decades, Atanuwë creates cults and spawn of chaos

**786**: Abbey of St. Clewyd established in Dolmenwood.

**800**: Charlemagne crowned Archontean Emperor, seen as the founding of the

**805**: In an attempt to bolster his own claims to the Eastern throne, Emperor
Nikephoros the Logothete dispatches an expedition led by Adrienic to reoccupy
the halls of Arden Vul.

**822**: Archontean attempt to recolonize Arden Vul ends in complete failure, as
Adrienic's forces disappear and are assumed to have been destroyed.

**850**: Wiskin tribes establish their parliament at Tórshavn, Færeyjar.

**1050**: The Almoravid Caliphate begins its conquests.

**1052**: Jean-Giscard Malévol abandons Castle Xyntillan.

**1054**: A schism shatters the unity of the Pluritine Church; the central
question is over the obvious power granted by saints, gods-turned-saints,
godlings, and elemental powers to their devotees. The Western half of the Empire
is mostly monolatrous, maintaining that the saints of the One True God deserve
devotion, but that the old gods and godlings are real though false and should
absolutely never be revered. The Eastern half is mostly henotheistic,
acknowledging the One True God, but insisting that the saints and
former-gods-now-saints of the Archontean Empire are true (though significantly
lesser) deities in their own right. A small portion of the faith in Archontos
itself maintains a monotheistic view: worship is due only to the One True God,
while saints (a broad term that includes godlings and former pagan gods) are
worthy only of reverent devotion; devotion to these saints ultimately redounds
wittingly or unwittingly to the benefit of the One True God, from whom comes all
clerical power.

**1061**: Lady Alexia Basileon leads a sept of the Knights of the Azure Shield
to a tiny Thorcin community named Gosterwick, near the falls of Arden Vul. The
knights restore an ancient fortress and Lady Alexia renames the community
Vetucaster; she proceeds to expand the community rapidly, offering residence,
citizenship, and services to adventurers and others.

**1062**: Town of Marrakesh founded.

**1066**: Norman conquest of Tribania. William becomes King William I of
Tribania. He pushes out the remaining Archontean foothold in Burdock's Valley,
but retains Archontean leaders and language there after extracting an oath of
fealty.

**1070s**: Harrying of the North in Tribania, where William I suppresses
northern Thorcin resistance with severe devastation and depopulation. The
Thorcin Recovery League is founded during this time.

**Current Year**: 1086

## Places

### Anfa _(Casablanca)_

Population: 3,700. Anfa is a lean, wind-swept harbour town on the edge of the
Atlantic, with sun-bleached walls and palm shade. The kasbah (citadel) towers
over a bustling, diverse bazaar where inland caravans trade goods with ships at
port. Due to its location on the cusp of both Atlantic traffic and inland
caravan routes, Anfa is known far and wide as an excellent place to find the
rarest alchemical and magical ingredients.

- _Exports: Fish, copper, animal byproducts, spices_
- _Imports: Fine textiles, iron tools and weapons_

### Archontos _(Rome)_

Population: 25,000. The original capital city of the Archontean empire. Formerly
one of the largest cities in the world, it has declined much of late. It's still
an important central enclave of the Pluritine Church, and culturally
significant, though its population is less than a tenth of its former glory.

- _Exports: Fine textiles, weapons & tools, olive oil, wine, holy objects_
- _Imports: Raw metals, cloth, dyes, spices_

### Ashenwilde, Fyrcashire, Tribania _(Liverpool)_

Population: 8,900. During the Great Conspiracy in 367-369, a days-long battle
erupted between Archontean and Thorcin mages; their fireballs and flame walls
scorched the earth for miles around the settlements of Portus Setantiorum. After
the land recovered, the ash proved to be an excellent fertilizer. A city sprang
up quickly, and the area was renamed; Fyrcashire is known now both for its
fertile farmlands and the prestigious Collegium Arcanum in its capital city of
Ashenwilde.

- _Exports: Grains & vegetables, animal byproducts, woolen cloth, dyes &
  chemicals_
- _Imports: Monster parts, fine textiles, wine, salt, gems_

### Brackenwold, Tribania

Home to some of the earliest human settlers of Tribania, the Duchy of
Brackenwold is at the center of south Tribania. Thick forests and wide river
plains cradle fortified estates, market towns, abbeys, and cathedrals. The
former kingdom, now under the vassalage of William I, includes Norwich and the
Table Downs, Castle Brackenwold and the Tithelands, High-Hankle and the High
Wold, and has at its heart the weird forest of Dolmenwood.

### Burdock's Valley, Tribania

(aka Burdoc Valley, Vale of Burgheat) The valley in southeastern Tribania in
which Arden Vul, as well as the town of Newmarket, is located. Known to the
local Thorcinga as the Vale of Burgheat, the valley is held as a vassal duchy by
an Archontean aristocrat, Iskander Basileon, who bears the title “Lord Burdock”
and has sworn an oath of fealty to King William I of Tribania.

### Camoldun, Sterich, Tribania _(Colchester)_

Population: 2,400. A major city in Archontean days and the first capital of
Tribania, Camoldun lost much of its population when the capital shifted to
Sterling several hundred years ago. Now, the borderlands town serves as \a
halfway stop between Sterling and Venta, and the seat of the baron of Camoldun.
Camoldun Castle itself is built directly atop the vaults of the old Archontean
temple, and rumors abound as to the riches below the town.

- _Exports: Grain & vegetables, animal byproducts_
- _Imports: Fine textiles, iron tools, wine_

### Canary Islands

These volcanic islands featured rugged terrain, stone and cave dwellings, while
small villages of locals live subsistence lifestyles based on farming, herding,
and fishing. The islands are a navigational marker and refuge for sailors, but
have no port or city. Still, they’re a useful stop for water, one which avoids
the more dangerous coastal waters of northwest Africa.

### Cape Verde Islands

Approximately three days west of Dakar, the Cape Verde Islands are volcanic,
arid, and sparsely populated with small fishing and pastoral settlements among
rugged landscapes. They are useful mainly as a refuge and fresh water supply
before the two-week sail across the deep sea.

### Castle Brackenwold, Brackenwold, Tribania

Population: 8,700. A great, walled town sprawled at the feet of a fortified
keep, Castle Brackenwold is an ancient place whose oldest parts were used by elf
lords in ancient times, before the people of Brackenwold migrated to Dolmenwood.
At the summit of a hill, the ducal castle is the ancestral home to the nobility
of the Brackenwold line. Alongside the mighty garrison maintained by the duke is
the great Cathedral of St. Signis, making this fortress-town also the centre of
the Church’s power in the region. Indeed, the Bishop of Brackenwold holds sway
over the Duchy nearly equal to the duke himself.

- _Exports: Livestock, tools, armor/weapons_
- _Imports: Beer/ale, wine, gems, fine textiles_

### Chebucto _(Halifax Harbour)_

Population: 1,100. Chebucto is a small Mi’kmaq town on a vast and protected
harbor surrounded by dense mixed forests and rugged cliffs. The land is rich
with freshwater springs and abundant wildlife including deer and seabirds.
Visiting sailors find safe anchorage and fresh supplies of fish and timber. The
surrounding wilderness offers opportunities for hunting and foraging while
repairing ships.

- _Exports: Fish, wood, furs & pelts, shellfish, berries and medicinal herbs_
- _Imports: Iron tools and metal goods, salt, woven cloth, grains and corn_

### Dakar, Kingdom of Takrur

Population: 2,800. Dakar is a modest coastal settlement with fishing and local
trade. The settlement is growing rapidly along with trade across the dangerous
Atlantic: It’s the last place to resupply before heading across the deep sea.
It’s a natural deep harbor, and links interior kingdoms to maritime trade
routes.

- _Exports: Gold, ivory, animal byproducts, monster parts_
- _Imports: Salt, iron tools, textiles_

### Faysting, Fyrcashire, Tribania

Population: 4,500. Located at the base of the Spine mountains and but a few
days' journey from Ashenwilde, Faysting is a common base for adventurers
exploring the nearby famed Stonehell dungeons or the abandoned Castle Malévol.
Backed by the famed Guild of Hamu, the sprawling town has everything a budding
adventurer needs to get themselves into trouble in the ancient prison.

- _Exports: Monster parts, books_
- _Imports: Tools, armour/weapons, ale/beer, medicinal herbs_

### Gosterwick, Burdock's Valley, Tribania

Population: 2,200. A truly new town, growing at the base of the cliff outside
Arden Vul, around the Azure Keep. Lady Alexia Basileon is actively recruiting
merchants, craftsmen, and adventurers to this location. The current population
bears a high proportion of adventurer-oriented businesses: sellers and buyers of
curios, general sutlers, trainers, etc.

- _Exports: Monster parts, books_
- _Imports: Tools, armor/weapons, ale/beer, medicinal herbs_

### Herjolfsnes, Grœnland _(Greenland)_

Population: 180. At the southern tip of Grœnland, Herjolfsnes is a small Wiskin
settlement of sod-roofed turf houses nestled against rocky, arctic shores with
towering glaciers inland. Sparse tundra vegetation marks the land, where hardy
settlers hunt seals and fish. Storms roll in from the icy seas, challenging
visitors to maintain their ships and supplies. Nearby, the harsh wilderness
promises encounters with polar bears or the eerie aurora borealis lighting the
night.

- _Exports: Walrus ivory, polar bear and seal skins, wool, walrus-hide rope,
  whale products, falcons_
- _Imports: Ground grain/corn, wood, iron tools & metal goods, salt, fine
  textiles_

### High-Hankle, Brackenwold, Tribania

Population: 5,300. The seat of administrative power in the barony of the High
Wold in Brackenwold lies between Sterling and Dolmenwood, amid a region of
windswept grasslands and rolling hills. The current baron is renowned for his
lax attitude to the law, more interested in wine and debauchery than in the
maintenance of order. High-Hankle has thus, in recent years, become a favoured
haunt for jaded nobles and hedonists of all stripes.

- _Exports: Woolen cloth, animal byproducts, grain & vegetables_
- _Imports: Ale/beer, fine textiles, fish, salt, silk, spices, wine_

### Kazildor

Kazildor is the subterranean realm of the dwarves, where the dwarven clans
conduct their age-old Endless War against their doppelganger enemies. The
dwarves are notoriously reclusive and suspicious, and few humans have been
permitted entrance to Kazildor. As a result, little is known of its size and
structures, as those few dwarves who travel under the sun are oathbound to
maintain the secrets of their people.

### Lankshorn, Brackenwold, Tribania

Population: 1,100. The northernmost settlement in the High Wold barony of
Brackenwold, the market town of Lankshorn lies within a bowshot of Dolmenwood’s
border, acting as one of the two main “thresholds” into the forest (the other
being Castle Brackenwold, in the east). Lankshorn is regarded as a cultural
oddity by outsiders, as the traditions of the civilized world meld with the
quaint, superstitious ways of Dolmenwood. The respect Lankshoners hold for the
longhorn breggle nobles of the wood is an apt example of the cultural melange in
this border-town. The finest bladesmith in the High Wold--perhaps even all of
Brackenwold--makes his home in Lankshorn.

- _Exports: Cider, cheeses, horses, hounds, livestock_
- _Imports: Tools, fine textiles, salt_

### Marajoáca, Chult _(Marajó, Amazon River mouth)_

Population: 6,300. Marajó is a sprawling river island of wetlands, seasonally
flooded forests, and savannahs. At its center, the walled town of Marajoáca is a
central gathering place for trade and worship, surrounded by fishponds and
cultivated fields. The waters of the Amazon provide a natural moat, and the
jungles of Chult lie beyond, full of alleged ancient Casarabe ruins and very
real dangers.

- _Exports: Gold, tropical hardwoods, exotic feathers, palm products, monster
  parts, and magic items._
- _Imports: Metals (iron tools especially), finished textiles, and luxury
  goods._

### Marrakesh, Morroco

Population 3,400. A rapidly growing sunburnt crossroads of a town, Marrakesh is
a magnet for travelers crossing the Atlas mountains into Takrur. Its market is
not as well-traveled and varied as Anfa's or Salā's on the coast, but it has
less of a military presence, ruled instead by a merchantile elite.

- _Exports: Spices, copper goods, animal byproducts, silk_
- _Imports: Salt, iron tools, fine textiles_

### Newmarket, Burdock's Valley, Tribania

Population: 4,000. The largest community in Burdock’s Valley, Newmarket lies on
the Swift River. It is a free town, exempt from the lordship of Lord Burdock and
governed by a mayor and council of aldermen. Although at least three days walk
from Arden Vul, it is a good site for adventurers to heal, train, resupply, and
trade. The major Factors and temples all have a presence in Newmarket. The local
villages sell their surplus in Newmarket, and merchants from Newmarket trade all
across Tribania and across the Channel to the Continent.

- _Exports: Grain & vegetables, game animals, fish, fruit, salt_
- _Imports: Silk, precious metals, gems_

### Porto, Portugal

Population: 17,000. Porto (aka “Waterdeep”) is a bustling river port at the
mouth of the Douro River, surrounded by steep hills and rocky granite outcrops.
The city thrives on trade, with busy quays, craftsmen’s workshops, and
fishermen’s boats. Merchant caravans and seafarers mingle in the crowded market
squares, while the city walls and towers offer defense against pirates and
Almoravids.

- _Exports: Salt, fish, wine, olive oil, linen cloth_
- _Imports: Precious metals, ivory, spices, cotton cloth, luxury textiles_

### Prigwort, Brackenwold, Tribania

Population: 2,800. The most populous settlement beneath the eaves of Dolmenwood,
the town of Prigwort is the centre-point of trade in the region, situated
halfway along the road that connects Castle Brackenwold and Fort Vulgar.
Prigwort is especially famed, even in the wider region of Tribania, for its
breweries and distilleries. Fine Prigwort spirits, flavoured with the wild herbs
of the forest, are found on the tables of connoisseurs far and wide. Of
particular interest to adventurers, it is also known that a magician of
commercial bent makes his home within the town.

- _Exports: Beer, ale, and spirits; medicinal herbs, livestock_
- _Imports: Tools, armour/weapons, common metals_

### Salā, Morocco _(Rabat)_

Population: 8,000. Salā is a militaristic city on the rise, founded by the
Umayyad dynasty. Built around the impressive Kasbah (citadel) of the Udayas
overlooking the Atlantic at the mouth of the Bou Regreg River, it serves as a
military stronghold, administrative center, and staging ground for the Almoravid
expansion into the Iberian Peninsula.

  traditional crafts including metalwork and textiles_

### Sandnaes, Grœnland _(Greenland)_

Population: 90. Located not far from Herjolfsnes, Sandnaes is another compact
Wiskin farmstead amid wind-battered cliffs and ice-strewn coasts. This is a much
poorer settlement than Herjolfsnes, but an important stop for sailors who want
to avoid deep waters.

  whale products, falcons._

villages among rolling hills, fertile valleys, and coastal bays. Their wooden
houses, plazas, and ceremonial ball courts form vibrant community centers. The
town of Santo Domingo hosts visitors interacting in lively trade for cassava,
pottery, and cotton cloth, and a base for exploring tropical forests rich with
birds, fruits, and rivers.

- _Imports: Tools and metal goods, spices, luxury goods._

### Seloy _(St. Augustine)_

Population: 1,700. The coastal plains near Seloy are warm and subtropical, with
dense pine forests and swamplands. The Timucua people have inhabited the area
since the -2400s in wooden villages surrounded by maize fields, and a small
settlement of Europeans has sprung up at a natural harbor. The sea breeze
carries the scent of salt and pine, while the inland terrain offers diverse
flora and fauna for foragers and hunters.

dominated by wooden houses, stone churches, and the imposing White Tower. The
bustling docks are filled with cargo from across Europe and the North Sea.
Onshore, narrow streets and aromatic markets offer exotic spices, textiles, and
goods. Nearby marshes, woods, and the Thames itself provide opportunities for
hunters, fishermen, and woodsmen. The city’s political intrigue and occasional
unrest make visits here both exciting and risky.

  ale and beer._

  goods._

### Takrur, Kingdom

The kingdom of Takrur sits along the lower Senegal River in Africa, a realm of
open savanna, river plains, and caravan paths that tie the Atlantic fringe to
the gold lands of the interior. Takrur recently officially embraced Sayfian
theology, and its rulers struggle to balance older local traditions with the new
philosophy. Caravans laden with gold, salt, and cloth pass through its markets,
newly enhanced via the close connection to the newly discovered Hesperia, and
the sounds of chanted verse float from temples, as the kingdom begins to expand
its cultural, economical, and possibly political horizons.

### Tiwaniku _(Bolivia)_

Population: 20,000. Tiwaniku rises like a stone mirage, its pale temples and
carved monoliths stark against the thin blue air of the high Andes mountains.
Tiwaniku's place as the the ritual and cultural center of Hesperia for the past
millenium has diminished somewhat over the last century, fueled by power
struggles and exacerbated by disagreements over what to do with the incursion of
Europeans to the continent. Most welcome new trade opportunities, but a cabal of
influential elves has led a campaign of aggressive isolation; the city
officially no longer welcomes outsiders, but smuggling is alive and well.

- _Exports: Gold, tropical hardwoods, exotic feathers, palm products, monster
  parts, and magic items._
- _Imports: Metals (iron tools especially), finished textiles, and luxury
  goods._

and rugged coastlines. Small farming settlements cluster near sheltered bays,
surrounded by steep hillsides and seabird colonies. Life is harsh and bold;
fishing, sheep herding, and boat repair dominate daily life. Visitors will

rivers, Þingvellir is both a stunning natural amphitheater and the site of the

springs release steam. Wiskin traders, farmers, and chieftains gather here to

### Vinvik, Vinland _(L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland)_

Population: 60. This coastal outpost is a bustling Wiskin base camp surrounded
by thick boreal forest, rolling hills, and rocky shores. Timber and game are
plentiful, and the site hums with the activity of ship repair, and trade with
the skraelings. Nearby dense woods hide bears and moose, providing both danger
and bounty.
